Without reading more into the case, I would *guess\\* that TOR had nothing to do with it, but instead it was his cell that did him in; maybe a file made it's way to a cloud drive by accident - apparently it was a Samsung. From this press release, it says that the FBI was notified of an IP with Tor traffic (so not necessarily cell phone relate); 5months later FBI then got a search warrant. So, why did the FBI want to be notified specifically about an IP with tor traffic? Seems more targeted. idk, but it is a little fun to play \"connect the dots\"."

The FBI has literally relied on hacking speciffic dark web sites to track users. There hasn't faults in the TOR network or protocol which has let to unmasking of users in bulk. Also, if you're doing crime on a level where the FBI, NSA, CIA or FSB is on your ass, then it's good to remember that TOR is only one tool in your privacy toolbox. You could for example use a VPN in concert with your TOR-connection to \"hide in plain sight\". It's also waaaay cheaper to just spin up more TOR nodes in VM's these days and super easy. A docker image, 5 minutes and a cold beer is all it requires. TOR is being updated actively, and when ever there's a security issue, it's fixed pretty fast. Even though the principle is the same as for 20 years ago, it's a whole other software stack. Dont forget that the United States, Russia and other big nations' own intelligence, state and diplomacy efforts also rely on TOR being available and secure.

        "content": "Even if we don't know specifically how often government agencies use timing analysis, it seems to me that they're shifting more towards blockchain analysis and crypto tracing due to how illicit dark web marketplaces have been increasingly relying on crypto in recent years. I saw recent news on the takedown of \"kidflix\" led by German law enforcement and Europol back in March 2025, and this particular article has some good info on how it was seized using crypto tracing. This other case (not in Germany but still somewhat relevant) also used crypto tracing to track down a dark web operator and occurred around the same timeframe. It also seems that law enforcement are working to develop ways of \"accessing encrypted data in a lawful manner, safeguarding cybersecurity and fundamental rights\" starting in 2026 (mentioned at the bottom of another kidflix article). IMO, I don't think authorities will continue leveraging traffic analysis or the use of NITs as often as before due to the backlash they receive over privacy concerns and that they will have to keep playing this reckless arms race against Tor developers. That's just my speculation."

        "content": "Just ask ChatGPT üòâ TLDR: Tor‚Äôs encryption hides content and routes, but not timing. If someone‚Äôs watching both ends, they can line up the traffic and unmask users. Detail: Timing analysis is one of the most effective passive attacks against Tor. It exploits the fact that, despite encryption and layered routing, timing patterns of packets entering and exiting the Tor network can still correlate. Here's how it works, no fluff: 1. Basic Principle If an adversary can observe traffic at both ends ‚Äî the client side (entry node) and the server side (exit node or destination) ‚Äî they can correlate the timing and volume of packets. Tor doesn‚Äôt add significant artificial delay or pad packet timing, so traffic patterns often remain identifiable. 2. Passive Correlation Attack An observer (like a global adversary or a well-positioned ISP or state actor) logs timestamps and sizes of packets entering the Tor network from a user. Simultaneously, they log packets leaving exit nodes to destinations. They then perform statistical analysis (like cross-correlation) to match those flows. 3. Active Timing Attacks In some cases, attackers can inject specific timing signatures (bursts, delays, or packet manipulation) at one end and look for those fingerprints on the other side. This makes the correlation easier and faster. 4. End-to-End Correlation Feasibility Tor is vulnerable here because: It doesn't obscure packet timing well. Many users don‚Äôt use padding or defenses like traffic obfuscation tools (e.g., obfs4). The number of users on a specific circuit might be small enough to make identification feasible. 5. Real-World Example The 2014 Operation Onymous takedown of darknet markets likely involved some form of traffic correlation (among other things), though full details were never disclosed. 6. Limitations This attack usually requires significant surveillance capability ‚Äî like monitoring major ISPs, having control of guard or exit nodes, or operating large-scale network sensors. Not cheap, but doable for state actors or well-funded entities. //"

        "content": "When using Google through Tor, you will end up allowing scripts, which can facilitate your tracking. On the Surface, the common internet you use every day; you can use Tor, but it will be very difficult to access Google services, such as its search engine, which will ask you to verify that you are not a robot. Not only Google, but numerous websites deny access via Tor on the Surface. YouTube itself may require you to log in to verify your identity if you use Tor. By logging in, you lose your anonymity. The issue is that on the Surface, Tor loses efficiency in anonymity; one of the reasons is that the traffic may not be end-to-end encrypted, and the exit node reveals your traffic. So always use HTTPS sites. If you use Tor on the Surface, use it more for privacy than anonymity, and do not log in to sites through Tor. You can switch to DuckDuckGo, but the search results will be less relevant. One way to hide your IP while still using the Tor network and maintain a certain level of anonymity and privacy in your searches is by using Orbot, selecting Portugal {PT} as the exit node, and setting it to work with your browser. Portugal may not be on the list of countries; you need to go to the settings and in node settings, enter/write {PT} in the exit node, restart Orbot, and you will be browsing through Portugal. You will significantly reduce the blocks that occur when browsing with a specific exit node, as many nodes are blocked due to misuse by many users. Portugal does not have this problem; at least until today, it works well on YouTube, but Google will always require robot verification, no matter which node you use. Using the Tor network more for privacy than anonymity is feasible. However, you may still encounter issues on websites due to the use of Tor's DNS, which is on port 5400. You can use DNSCrypt to redirect only the DNS to an alternative DNS. DNSCrypt can also hide your DNS traffic. You have some options like InviziblePro for Android or Rethink DNS; both can use the Tor network or connect Orbot and still redirect only the DNS to another of your choice. You can find these apps on F-Droid. These are ways to use the Tor network for privacy on the Surface and not real anonymity. For true anonymity, nothing replaces the Tor browser."

Without going too deep in how Tor works, Tor has \"exit nodes\", and the IP of the Exit Node is what the destination will see - As of today, I am not aware of any exit nodes within China. You can check this for yourself: Why does the country not always change? --- China --- Since you brought up China, understand that any agency / company (like ISP) will know that an IP has Tor traffic, just like they will know if an IP address has VPN traffic. All they know is that your IP has Tor traffic, but in some countries, this is enough for authorities to visit you to ask questions, if not more. This is why obfs4 bridges were introduced - it attempts to make the Tor traffic look like random data, and by using a non-public Tor server, it is not as obvious that the traffic from your IP is in fact Tor traffic."

        "content": "Encouraging those who use Tor to log into accounts puts their anonymity at risk. (If the use of Tor is solely for privacy purposes, that's fine.) However, if the intention is anonymity, you are essentially telling them to reveal their exact location. The question here is twofold: what do they intend to achieve with Tor‚Äîanonymity or privacy? If the goal is anonymity, they should not log in while using Tor. The reason is that the websites they visit, if they have logged in before, already have their true IP address! It's like trying to make a purchase on an online shopping site, providing your CPF, personal information, and location, but accessing it through Tor‚Äîwhat's the point? It‚Äôs pointless. Additionally, accessing certain accounts with Tor may lead websites to recognize inappropriate access, significantly increasing the chances of losing the account or even being blocked. There is also the issue of scripts. Suppose they log into an account on a site like Facebook or any other social network or website; if there is a specific script, it can track them across the internet, and even if they are not logged in, it will know who they are through IP association, since they logged into their account where their real identity is already registered. If they use Tor solely for privacy, it means they only intend to hide their IP and encrypt their traffic. The second aspect of traffic encryption, nowadays with HTTPS being standard on websites, already provides encryption for traffic, and hiding the IP is useful for privacy. However, they would still be at risk of having their account blocked if they log into certain sites or social networks due to access with Tor, which has its IPs associated with inappropriate use. Additionally, they may encounter issues with sites asking them to confirm they are not a robot. In summary, if they seek only privacy using Tor, it is feasible, but it won't be easy, and the more precise the security, privacy, and anonymity they want, the less comfort they will have in their browsing. It is not advisable to make it seem acceptable to log in on Tor. This poses a huge risk for those who believe it is fine, leading their trust to result in a self-inflicted wound. The example given about China and bypassing country or regional blocks can be resolved with a VPN; there is no need to use Tor. Tor is for specific use, and many who use it solely for privacy face challenges in navigating the web. Furthermore, for just privacy, it requires advanced configuration and significantly reduces the level of anonymity!"

        "content": "Not a naive question at all ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually the core of how Privora works! Yes, each client in Privora is its own Tor Onion Service. ‚Ä¢ When a user launches the app, it automatically spins up a hidden service in the background. ‚Ä¢ The .onion address acts as the user‚Äôs ‚Äúidentity‚Äù ‚Äî but without any central registration or username system. ‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs no tracking server, no central directory ‚Äî only the local app knows the private key tied to the onion address. ‚Ä¢ Communication happens peer-to-peer between two Onion Services over Tor (using mutual connections). Discovery and connection work like this: ‚Ä¢ Two users must meet at least once in real life (or through a trusted offline channel). ‚Ä¢ During this encounter, they exchange their Onion addresses securely (e.g., via QR code or encrypted short links). ‚Ä¢ After that, they can message each other directly over Tor ‚Äî no servers, no IP addresses exposed, no third-party involved. So there‚Äôs no global ‚Äúlist‚Äù of users, no central lookup table, and no metadata leaks. The Onion address itself is enough to connect ‚Äî and if a user wants to rotate identities, they can easily spin up a new one. Let me know if you want more technical details ‚Äî like how we handle key persistence, encryption layering, or (future) ephemeral messaging! https://privora.netlify.app"

        "author": "Privora",
        "content": "Thanks a lot for your incredibly thoughtful observations ‚Äî exactly the kind of discussion that helps Privora become better. Let me go through your points carefully: Identity Rotation and Re-Friending: You‚Äôre absolutely right ‚Äî if a user rotates their Onion address, they would need to re-establish trust with their contacts. ‚Ä¢ If a contact blocks unknown connections, the users would need to meet again offline (or via a trusted out-of-band channel) to exchange new addresses. ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs very similar to the classic phone number change scenario you described. ‚Ä¢ There are plans to make re-establishing trust as smooth as possible, possibly by using signed contact references (with the old and new identities linked securely). Key Persistence: Yes, an Onion address itself does not expire after 24 hours. ‚Ä¢ Only the service descriptor (how your Onion address is advertised inside the Tor network) needs refreshing approximately every 24 hours. ‚Ä¢ The app will handle this by running lightweight heartbeat/background updates to keep the address alive. ‚Ä¢ If a device goes offline for an extended time, the descriptor may temporarily disappear from the network ‚Äî but as soon as the device reconnects and republishes, the Onion address remains valid as long as the private key remains safe. Background Activity: ‚Ä¢ The app only needs small, infrequent background tasks to maintain hidden service registration. ‚Ä¢ No persistent background sockets or polling, keeping resource usage and battery impact minimal. Encryption Layering: Yes, there will be additional end-to-end encryption on the app level, completely independent of Tor‚Äôs transport layer encryption. ‚Ä¢ Every message will be encrypted with the recipient‚Äôs public key before being sent. ‚Ä¢ Even if Tor itself were compromised, the payload would remain unreadable without the recipient‚Äôs private key. (Future) Ephemeral Messaging: 100% agreed ‚Äî ephemeral messaging is on the roadmap. ‚Ä¢ Conversations could automatically expire and delete themselves after delivery, after reading, or after a custom user-defined time. ‚Ä¢ No long-term storage of sensitive content. APNs (Apple Push Notifications) ‚Äî Optional and Encrypted: ‚Ä¢ If a user is offline and cannot maintain a descriptor, Privora can optionally use APNs to alert the user that someone attempted to reach them. ‚Ä¢ This is strictly opt-in, and the user can enable or disable it at any time. ‚Ä¢ Even when using APNs, the push payload is fully encrypted asynchronously ‚Äî meaning that Apple‚Äôs servers only handle meaningless ciphertext blobs, without metadata, message content, or sender/receiver info. Possible Future Feature (Compromise Detection): Your idea about automatic identity rotation and secure wiping in case of compromise detection is excellent. ‚Ä¢ Planned features would include: ‚Ä¢ Wiping local conversation history upon detection. ‚Ä¢ Securely deleting the local private key. ‚Ä¢ Deleting local copies of the contact list. ‚Ä¢ Forcing a new Onion service creation. ‚Ä¢ Warning users that trust must be re-established. This fits Privora‚Äôs philosophy perfectly and is absolutely something I‚Äôll be working into future threat models. Again, I truly appreciate your engagement ‚Äî the depth of your thinking is incredibly valuable. Thank you!"

Qubes lets you have various VMs that do the isolation - that is - that permit that while you are dealing with one task, another does not get in your way and does not deanonymize you. I would put Dread Pirate Roberts example, his GMAIL account got in his way because he was dealing with Silk Road on the same environment. Now TAILS is more simple, it's literally The Amnesiac Incognito Live System. If you use this, you are to expect to use it as a live system (not doing anything persistent), it means that if you have one task you use Tails for it and then GTFO. Wan't to use it again for something different or the same task? Save what you have securely (in this part persistence may not be so bad if limited) and use it live. To answer your question, you would use QubesOS if your OpSec needs persistence and/or is dealing with different tasks on a daily basis that require anonymity. But it also requires you to RTFM and learn it well, as to not do any mistakes. TAILS is simpler, easier and does the job. In other words, if you're asking this, Tails is the answer."

The complexity of setting things up may be trivial for your overall configuration, but I am guessing you don't want to have to reconfigure Qubes every time you power-on the machine, especially if the configuration isn't trivial. Can you clarify how you want the amnesic feature of Tails to work for you with Qubes? Or how do you see this merging of features working? -- Edit -- I see others commenting to just run a Whonix Cube; Perhaps this is what you are looking for? Not that Qubes is amnesic but that the Cube from which you \"Tor\" is Amnesic. Running a Whonix Cube should do the trick as tearing down the VM \"wipes the slate clean\"."

Even our relatively unknown IP addresses used by employees and customers are attacked, and are behind CDNs mainly for this reason. A single script kiddie attack from one or two IP Address won't even be noticed. And I suspect that the Tor network knows when a relay is under attack (reduced bandwidth) and just doesn't use that relay."

        "content": "with all the variety and effectiveness of traditional DoS attacks, Well, not very effective when your network knows how to respond. Attacks are mitigated at the edge of networks, not on individual devices. DDoS mitigation is heavily automated and is performed at many levels on the Internet. It isn't up to the targeted server to deal with the attack. Attack mitigation is largely automated for many networks. There is a big difference between DoS and DDoS. I am not sure which you are referring to, because a DoS from a single source is easily handled with by most networks. ISP interconnects these days are frequently 400 or 800gbps. 800gbps routers are off-the-shelf. We have 100gbps ISP links at our two data centers. Very few people will have access to a single device with a fast enough connection that can't easily be black-holed. Someone trying to DoS from home won't even be noticed, and probably would be automatically blocked by the attacker's own ISP. DDoS is quite different, you need to block by the characteristics of the attack, not source address. But again, saturating modern ISP and data centers networks is quite difficult. Again, if a server is connected to a network and/or ISP that knows what they are doing, the server will be unaffected. The directory servers are distributed around the world, each behind different networks. Tor is robust and works around problems. You might find this interesting. Remember, Cloudflare is just one network, all networks are experiencing the same things. https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q4/"

I can only guess that the official Tor team is focusing more on the availability of the Tor network. However, Tor is also at risk of de-anonymisation in addition to DoS threats. Although Tor has officially developed Guard mechanisms that make it difficult for attackers to control the entry point to a target (client or onion service), a large number of papers have proven that it is still possible to enforce de-anonymisation on a target. I'm curious to know if Tor has made any other fixes to enhance anonymity besides the Vanguard mechanism?"
