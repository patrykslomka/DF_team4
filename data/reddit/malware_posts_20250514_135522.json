For a fairly comprehensive list of detection mechanisms you need to defeat, read the source of VMaware. You would get a good head start basing your work on CAPEv2. It runs best on bare metal with patched QEMU and SeaBios to look more like real hardware. Dont worry too much about tools inside the box raising alarms. If it was that easy to scare most malware off, we'd all be running a kernel debugger or Valorant instead of antivirus."
