That would just be terrible procedure on every level.

        "content": "Can you explain Tor, Tor bridges, and Tails like I'm a fifth grader? Sure! Here's a simple explanation, like you're in 5th grade: Tor is like a magic tunnel for the internet. When you use it, your computer's message bounces through three secret places before it gets to the website you want. That way, no one can tell who you are or where you're going online. It’s like putting on an invisibility cloak while you surf the web. Sometimes, mean people (like bad governments or schools) try to block the magic tunnel so you can’t use it. A Tor bridge is a secret hidden doorway to the tunnel that they don’t know about. So even if the main tunnel is blocked, you can still sneak in through the secret door and stay safe. Tails is like a superhero USB stick. You plug it into a computer, and it starts a special super-private system. It forgets everything you do after you turn it off, and it uses Tor to keep everything you do online secret. It's like wearing an invisibility cloak for your computer!"
