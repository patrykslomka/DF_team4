Yes he was the first but he was beyond sloppy and his power either went to his head or he never was a.good guy to begin with. Every administrator should accept they will go away for 20 to life for what they're facilitating. Ross barely did 11yrs and got pardoned by a president who operates by transactionly and not out of principal. So what did he give Trump Onions have been a part of my life and has truly made my life better. I would rather have a rug pull and lose money that wasn't withdrawn, than have a permanent black eye like Ross gave things. The dark web is a weirdly trust worthy place if you're not stupid. I tell people it's like an honor among thieves. A nameless enigma of an administrator that is present but doesn't draw attention is best.

While NoScript is a powerful tool, most users find it confusing to configure manually. That’s why the Tor Project integrated it this way, to make it more user-friendly. The slider disables JavaScript depending on the security level, but not through the regular browser settings. To fully disable JavaScript via about:config, it must be done manually, as I explained in the comment and post."

        "content": "JavaScript can be used to deanonymize you no matter where you’re connected from, it doesn’t matter if you’re on your home network or not. It can pull together fingerprinting data like your screen size, fonts, time zone, OS, browser version, WebGL info, and more, creating a unique profile that tracks you across websites. It can also log how you type or move your mouse, basically tracking your behavior to re-identify you later. In more serious cases, malicious scripts might try to force your browser to load resources from outside the Tor network, like images or hidden requests to third-party servers, potentially leaking metadata or exposing your behavior. Some advanced scripts may even try to exploit browser or OS bugs to extract sensitive data. To stay safe, go into about:config, search for javascript.enabled, set it to false, and restart the browser, because changes in about:config don’t fully apply until you do. If you’re using Whonix or Whonix in Qubes OS, that setting will stick across reboots. But if you’re on Tails, you’ll have to do this every time you boot up, since Tails doesn’t save browser settings in persistent storage. https://browserleaks.com/javascript https://panopticlick.eff.org/"

If it's above board, then all good. If not, don't send directly from the exchange. You need an intermediary and don't use BTC in the end transaction ever as it's traceable. Something like this would be a simple way of avoiding that. This is just an example. There will be better/simpler/safer ways. Buy LTC from Kraken. Download Cake Wallet. Set up an LTC and XMR wallet on it. Transfer LTC from Kraken to Cake Wallet. Swap LTC to XMR. Send XMR as payment."

No feds will just wreck your door and arrest you. Be cool. That is not how the \"bad Opsec of clearnet\" works.

I need to change my request to use Tor. Sure, I can force my code to bypass this block, but that’s a conscious decision by me to not use Tor. Whonix, on the other hand, from what I read, “automatically” (not sure on the details), “routes” all traffic through Tor. So, with TailsOS, I get an error. With Whonix, I’m auto-Tor’ified.
