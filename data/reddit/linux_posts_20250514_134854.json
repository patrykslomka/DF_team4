If there's another discussion on the topic, the link is welcome to be submitted as a top level comment to aid the previous discussion. Please see: r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains No memes, image macros, rage comics, overdone jokes - Meme posts of any kind are not allowed in r/linux. Feel free to post over at /r/linuxmemes instead. This rule can also apply to comments, including overdone jokes, comment-chain jokes, or other redditisms that are popular elsewhere. Reddiquette, trolling, or poor discussion - r/linux asks all users follow Reddiquette. Reddiquette is ever changing, so a revisit once in awhile is recommended. Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, or not \"Remembering the human\" aka being hostile or incredibly impolite. Additionally, sexism/racism/other isms are not allowed.

We set that no more than 10% of your posts should be your content. Please be aware that this does not supersede other rules. Additionally, surveys for your blog/news source/paper/own use are not allowed. Please see /r/linux/wiki/rules/crowdfunding for those crowdfunding.. No misdirecting links, sites that require a login, or URL shorteners - In short: if your link doesn't go right to the content it will be removed. Sites that require a login to view the content are not allowed in r/linux. Example: A private Facebook post or a news organization that doesn't have free article views. URL shorteners and links that misdirect users to ads/jokes are also banned. See a list here, although the mods will make a decision on a per domain basis as needed: /r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains No NSFW - No NSFW links or images without mod approval. No discussion that is overly-suggestive to what is normally considered NSFW. Non-useful Image Upload/Fluff Image - Images of \"Linux in the wild\", plushies, Tux, and more are not encouraged for posting as a top level submission.

Also of interest: Update on Newton, the Wayland-native accessibility project So, yes, this is being worked on. But no, it's not there yet and progress is slow because there is not much developer interest in this topic. If you have the expertise, I'm sure your contributions will be welcome. Why is that? Because low-level Wayland work requires a very specialized skill set.

The draft Wayland accessibility protocol you linked is particularly interesting - it shows there's at least some effort to build accessibility directly into the Wayland protocol rather than as an afterthought. And the Newton project for GNOME looks promising as a longer-term solution. Your point about the skills gap is spot-on and explains a lot about why progress has been so slow. The intersection of developers who understand low-level Wayland protocol development, have accessibility knowledge, AND are motivated to work on accessibility is understandably tiny. This creates a difficult situation: those of us who most need these accessibility features (people with disabilities) often aren't in a position to implement the low-level protocol work needed, while those with the technical skills to do so rarely have firsthand experience with accessibility needs or motivation to prioritize them. It's a classic catch-22 that many accessibility issues face - the people most affected are often the least empowered to fix the underlying technical problems. I wish I could contribute to the protocol work directly, but my skills are in application development rather than display server protocols. What I can do is continue developing cross-platform accessibility tools, documenting the challenges, and advocating for these issues to get more attention and resources. Thank you for helping spread awareness about these projects - I'll definitely keep an eye on both the draft protocol and Newton's progress."

So much of current accessibility features with X11 are simply hacked into place based on what was available at the time because of the model that X happened to have, it was not designed for accessibility either. It was instead designed to allow an application running on one computer to be displayed in a different one, with security being barely an afterthought, and accessibility functionality being possible merely an accident. Now we can make SURE that the environments of the future actually expose the exact functionality that people really need, rather than being limited to just what happens to be possible in X."

Libei (Linux Emulated Input) is a promising project specifically designed to enable input event emulation in Wayland - exactly what accessibility tools like dwell clickers need. The architecture seems solid: libei provides an API for applications to talk to Wayland compositors and send emulated input events, essentially mimicking the libinput-to-compositor connection but for emulated events. It's designed to be a standardized solution that, once implemented in Wayland compositors, could solve the input simulation problem. I should also mention that I rely on an on-screen keyboard, and Wayland doesn't even have a quality one available. This makes it impossible for me to test programs on Wayland. Currently, I have to use a Linux VM with X11's \"onboard\" on-screen keyboard as a workaround. This is yet another critical accessibility gap in the Wayland ecosystem."

Then the scope taken on was too extensive and some pragmatism was needed. Or if there is no other choice than adjust expectations and don't try to deliver it in 2018 when it's far from ready. (My criticism is less on developers and more on distro leaders, mainly Red Hat) I'm just a lowly web developer, but if even the KDE guys took until 2024 to make Wayland actually work somehow - there is a problem. I will say that I'm usually of the opinion that you shouldn't criticize open source projects too much - but this isn't exactly 4 guys working over spare weekends. It was pushed by Red Hat, and it's a major part of the linux userspace. For me as a user, the migration has been the most painful years of using Linux since about 2005.

Or if there is no other choice than adjust expectations and don't try to deliver it in 2018 when it's far from ready. (My criticism is less on developers and more on distro leaders, mainly Red Hat) On the contrary. GNOME shipping Wayland early was a pragmatic choice, it got developer attention from the wider Linux community, telling people \"this is happening, get involved\". Progress would've been much slower if they just waited around and tried doing everything themselves. I'm just a lowly web developer, but if even the KDE guys took until 2024 to make Wayland actually work somehow - there is a problem. KDE's Wayland session was very usable in 2020. It had issues, of course, but it never forced me to switch back to X11 (I never launched an X11 session since I got my AMD GPU around that time). I will say that I'm usually of the opinion that you shouldn't criticize open source projects too much - but this isn't exactly 4 guys working over spare weekends. You'd be surprised. The Linux graphics/Wayland ecosystem is very spread out. There absolutely are many components that are just maintained by a couple of people. Even if you have Red Hat or Collabora sending patches, they still have to be reviewed. For me as a user, the migration has been the most painful years of using Linux since about 2005. The spec was pushed too early before DE, libraries and software that were supposed to use the protocol were ready (even though it was already a decade at that point) and it really hurt end users. I don't think any of this is true. Distros only started switching to Wayland once it was viable (except maybe Fedora). And you always had the option of just switching to X11. I'll say this again: they needed to push it to users to be able to get it completed. The Wayland developers don't have domain knowledge on every single thing one can do with a computer. They need user and application developer feedback to be able to design protocols that Wayland users need. Without putting Wayland at the forefront, app developers aren't going to reach out to add what's necessary for their app to work on Wayland."

I foolishly had grub-customizer installed. During an upgrade from 20.3 to 21.0 I think it was, a library the customizer used was upgraded. Customizer was removed from the repos on that newer version, so it did not get an upgrade. So because th customizer didn't run, it actually killed the entire grub generation process and left me with empty grub config files. That is, no boot options at all. Manually booting into my system via grub's rescue shell, I couldn't disentangle the customizer from grub. Reinstalling didn't help, deleting everything would leave me with only half of what I needed - missing the files Mint packaged originally. So instead I installed rEFInd. With that, the OS was automatically detected and would just boot. Security that even if I manage to kill my config again, it will still boot. Later on I wrote software to generate config entries for rEFInd based on my btrfs snapshots (ty Timeshift), and now what was originally a big issue is now one of my favourite parts of my install.

    "content": "GNU/Linux is a free and open source software operating system for computers. The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work. Free, Libre and open source software (FLOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, and change it. GNU/Linux is a collaborative effort between the GNU project, formed in 1983 to develop the GNU operating system and the development team of Linux, a kernel. Linux is also used without GNU in embedded systems, mobile phones, and more. These can include things like Android or ChromeOS. GNU itself is also used without Linux, some examples appear in projects like Debian/kFreebsd and Guix GNU/Hurd.

GNU/Linux Related: Distributions: Debian based RedHat Unique Linux with Proprietary Elements Embedded Linux on Mobile: Movements: Desktop Environments: Window Managers: Fluff Learning/resources Creativity: Help Webcasts: Other operating systems: Please review full details on rules here.. All rules will be applied regardless of the number upvotes a post/comment has. No support requests - This is not a support forum! Head to /r/linuxquestions or /r/linux4noobs for support or help. Looking for a distro? Try r/findmeadistro. No spamblog submissions - Posts should be submitted using the original source with the original title. Posts that are identified as either blog-spam, a link aggregator, or an otherwise low-effort website are to be removed. Some reasons for removal are that they contain re-hosted content, usually paired with privacy-invading ads. If there's another discussion on the topic, the link is welcome to be submitted as a top level comment to aid the previous discussion. Please see: r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains No memes, image macros, rage comics, overdone jokes - Meme posts of any kind are not allowed in r/linux. Feel free to post over at /r/linuxmemes instead. This rule can also apply to comments, including overdone jokes, comment-chain jokes, or other redditisms that are popular elsewhere. Reddiquette, trolling, or poor discussion - r/linux asks all users follow Reddiquette. Reddiquette is ever changing, so a revisit once in awhile is recommended. Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, or not \"Remembering the human\" aka being hostile or incredibly impolite. Additionally, sexism/racism/other isms are not allowed. See also: /r/linux/wiki/rules/userconduct Relevance to r/linux community / Promoting closed source applications over FOSS - Posts should follow what the community likes: GNU, Linux kernel, developers of open source software, or other applications on Linux. Take some time to get the feel of the subreddit if you're not sure! Spamming self-promotion, surveys, crowdfunding - Submitting your own original content is welcome on r/linux, but we do ask that you contribute more than just your own content to the subreddit as well as require you to interact with the comments of your submission. We set that no more than 10% of your posts should be your content. Please be aware that this does not supersede other rules. Additionally, surveys for your blog/news source/paper/own use are not allowed. Please see /r/linux/wiki/rules/crowdfunding for those crowdfunding.. No misdirecting links, sites that require a login, or URL shorteners - In short: if your link doesn't go right to the content it will be removed. Sites that require a login to view the content are not allowed in r/linux. Example: A private Facebook post or a news organization that doesn't have free article views. URL shorteners and links that misdirect users to ads/jokes are also banned. See a list here, although the mods will make a decision on a per domain basis as needed: /r/linux/wiki/rules/banneddomains No NSFW - No NSFW links or images without mod approval. No discussion that is overly-suggestive to what is normally considered NSFW. Non-useful Image Upload/Fluff Image - Images of \"Linux in the wild\", plushies, Tux, and more are not encouraged for posting as a top level submission. If necessary, this can apply to comments too at mod discretion. The image/video upload feature is for posts regarding features/guides/etc. See also: Meme rule.

        "content": "The Linux Foundation is obligated to follow laws (U.S. and otherwise), but that doesn't give the government control over Linux. Linus Torvalds likes to say that his kernel is just one opinion about what Linux is. The vast majority of us treat Linus' kernel as the kernel, but anyone is free to keep their own branch (almost unavoidable with git), reject certain changes, and keep a set of private modifications. Diverging too far would quickly become annoying, so there would have to be a credible threat embedded in Linus' kernel to make it worth it."

They all have their own tree full of patches that are either backported into that version or haven't been accepted into mainline, including some things (like ZFS) that can't be merged due to licensing. That was the heart of the problem with Unix fragmentation -- licenses weren't compatible. The viral nature of the GPL makes forking a project better in the long run because you have more people trying and figuring out different ways to solve problems."

There's uClinux for microcontrollers and ELKS for 16-bit machines. So, in short, there are many specialized alternatives. But everyone follows Linus' tree."
