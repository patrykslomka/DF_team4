Maintaining two subreddits mirroring each other provides few benefits while diverting our team from providing the level of service you deserve and expect. Thus, we’ve restricted r/PrivacyToolsIO, and invite you to join us on r/PrivacyGuides. Thank you so much for your years of involvement, support and appreciation. We look forward to providing many more years of unbiased, non-commercial and transparent privacy-related news and reviews. Join us! Please participate with suggestions and constructive criticism. Please enjoy our PTIO Wiki! Our Sept ’19 PTIO Team IAMA on r/Privacy was amazing and is chock full of tips & info! Do you have a project that you want to promote here? Open an Issue on our GitHub repo so our entire team can advise and evaluate it first. Thanks! For detailed descriptions for each of these rules please consult the rules sidebar in the new Reddit redesign (our canonical set of rules).",

This subreddit will stop accepting submissions in a few weeks, but since you already posted here maybe you'd want to consider cross-posting this post there as well to keep the discussion going!
