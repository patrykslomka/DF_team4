That said, stepping into Linux takes a little bit of work, and some people just aren't going to want to have to learn a few new things, even among privacy advocates. Plus, while most games will now work on Linux (as a Linux user I have hundreds of games I play with no trouble at all), there are some which don't and that can be a dealbreaker if you want to buy the new AAA game that has Denuvo or some garbage on it. Regardless, Microsoft has long since made it clear they don't give two shits what their users want, they're just going to keep hoovering up that data and making bigger back doors for agencies to see everything you do."

Over the years, Microsoft made mistakes, but they always seemed to push for the professional and polished be all end all of operating systems. As far as I'm concerned, Windows 7 was their last truly great OS. After that, they gave in to the enshittification all corporations eventually succumb to, where it became more important to maximize shareholder value at the expense of literally everything else, including the user experience. Nowadays, I don't recommend Windows to anyone."

It was my right to do it but I then had to go through a traditional pat down search which I preferred over the scan. Pat down searches are still a thing and done randomly on a daily basis. The number of times I got blowback from the TSA employees was amazing. They would often do what I call a \"reprisal search.\" They'd loudly and dramatically remove me from the area, dump all my things from a bag which was not even going to go through the body scanner and was already searched by xray, then take their time patting me down and sometimes be rough about it. Passengers in a hurry look at you like you are dirt. Each airport has a TSA site manager. Two of my friends hold these positions at different airports and they are responsible for all of TSA at their airports. They told me to not go through the chain of command next time I have an issue but to demand to see airport TSA supervisor. They have to ask for them and will fix it immediately."

Net income jumped 35 per cent to $16.7bn, well above consensus estimates of $13.5bn. Meta shares were up more than 6 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday. The tech giant forecast its second-quarter revenues would be between $42.5bn and $45.5bn, with the midpoint of that range slightly higher than Wall Street’s forecast of $43.8bn. When the FTC fined them $5 billion dollars, their shares went up because they had set aside $7 billion, so they had \"saved\" $2b. Honestly, fines cannot be big enough. They need to be regulated into oblivion if the behavior actually needs to stop. If you're a drunk driver you get pulled off the road. You don't pay a fine and drive home."

I've asked moderators to pin this to the sidebar or to the top but it's never been done. Millions of Americans have privacy rights and can make request to opt out of targeted advertising, delete their data, and more, yet they have no idea. Here is a comprehensive list of all state laws that have been passed, that are currently in congress (state level), that failed to pass, and the rights all of these laws give you. It drives me crazy that we don't have any subreddit dedicated to pushing strong state privacy laws. EVERYONE wants a federal law but I can promise you that anything the federal government gives us is going to be some watered down bullshit. If your state has a bill currently in congress, READ IT AND WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE. Actually read it. Make sure it gives you the rights you want. Let them know if you think it should be stronger.

A good go-to is medical stuff. That info is intimate and protected in other aspects of our lives, but it's easy for folks to overlook the things they casually Google. E.g.

You can't remove any part of that ID without breaking the link. On YouTube, the si parameter is your sharing incident ID that tracks you, but if you were to remove the v parameter, then the link would not work anymore because that's the video ID. Stack Overflow inserts your user ID into sharing links as part of the path, at the end. If you know what it is, you can remove it, or just know not to use the sharing buttons. You'd basically need to be a web developer to figure all this shit out on your own."

The police department in my area is trying to get people who have private cameras on their building and homes to sign up to allow cops to use them or their data to \"solve crimes.\" .They also bought portable cameras for events that are capable of facial recognition. We're already in this 24/7 surveillance reality unfortunately."

Another example of mass arrests in the UK from one van being parked in town centers A man who covered his face when he saw one of these vans was arrested, charged with ‘Disorderly Behaviour’ and fined £90 - for the crime of covering his face in public! As anyone with half a brain would know already, facial recognition technology is a complete mess when it comes to black people - leading to false identification, arrests and imprisonment"

The cops said don't worry we will not use the facial recognition capability of the software, we'll just use the cameras for \"monitoring the event\" as it's happening. Yeah. Sure you will."

So not only are they monitoring every time I pass thru these intersections in my car, they are also monitoring every time I go by on foot or on my bicycle. They also put up cameras on a section of a public recreation trail. They justified that by saying that homeless people were causing too much trouble there and they had to monitor them. Then they came through and made all the homeless people leave and threw away all their tents and stuff yet the cameras are still there."

A town down the way from me keeps \"suspected criminals with criminal records\" on file for 30days min to share with other leo's. The Chief hasnt defined what that criteria is for them to label someones vehicle suspicous. It wasnt constitutional before the flocks and it sure af isnt constitutional now."
