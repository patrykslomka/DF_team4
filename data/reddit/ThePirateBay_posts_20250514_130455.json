If ‚Äúmost people‚Äù (and btw more people visit pornhub than reddit everyday, so idk where you getting g your numbers from other than inside your asshole‚Ä¶) think censoring porn is ok, I really don‚Äôt care.

All the info is readily available just go poke around. Remember what you are asking is for someone to tell you in exacting terms how to break several laws...... most don't want/need that liability."

In your torrenting client the first thing you need to do is force encryption on the connections so data stream cannot be identified by ISP (internet service provider). Next you will need to do is purchase a VPN subscription. do not use the unreliable and slow free shit. Pay for one. VPN is virtual private network which makes it virtually impossible to find out which ISP you are you using so little chance for the feds to be knocking on your door at 4 in the morning. I use Surfshark and NordVPN owns them so I guess I can recommend them both although I never used NordVPN. A multi hop connection is better which Surfshark offers but I actually do not use it. I connect to the NYC one which is fast. I do not notice any slow down when connected to the VPN. have any other questions dm me. I have no life and lots of time."
