I currently work for a FAANG company that could do it but may be somewhere else by then so we're not relying on that. As I said, this was in the works even when we thought Harris would win.

Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne acquired the consultancy in November 2023, and Krebs became SentinelOne's chief intelligence and public policy officer. Trump's order said security clearances for individuals at Sentinel One would also be revoked pending review. So technically they want to strip clearances from the 'Krebs Stamos Group' consultancy. But if that doesn't exist as a standalone org after being acquired , then I guess they just used the transitive property to name SentinelOne in that executive order instead? Lol don't think it works that way"

In 2020 democrats won all three again, lost it in 2022. Rarely does the presidential party that wins an election maintains that hold after. That means democrats have 2 years to get shit done. Instead they sit on their asses and then say \"well we can't do anything now\" after they lose everything. That's probably why Trump is going into turbo mode right out of the gate.

They previous two wedge issues were \"woke\" issues (defund the police, BLM, SWJ, CRT) and before that? Guns. The left kinda just kept giving up on all these issues. What's in common with all those wedge issues? The right-wing ecosystem made them into wedge issues in the first place. The left has no version of what the right does. The left doesn't have the level of billionaires bankrolling their ideological issues like the right does. So what the right does do? They make up a wedge issue, it riles up their base and they win elections. The left goes on defense, the right goes on attack until people get sick of those issues, and the right eventually makes up a new wedge issue and everyone forgets the old wedge issues cause they weren't really that important in the first place. They were just a political narrative selling point. The left continues to not have their own \"Tea Party\" movement so their own voters only show up when there's disaster to win back elections. Democrats spend years fixing the Republicans mess and by the time things are going well again, Republicans win elections and fuck it all up again. We repeat the cycle as Democrats are probably going to kill it in the midterms. The leftist voters needs to start electing more politicians with real balls like Al Franken (until he was forced out by idiots), AOC, Sanders, Van Hollen, Crockett, and Al Green and so on if they want to fight the MAGA agenda."

The implications given the modern business/government climate are terrifying, or at least should be terrifying. AI is like the polygraph, except with the polygraph, it came about at a time when people were smarter, wiser, and more ethical, so sanity prevailed and it can't be used as evidence of anything at least in court (although it can still ruin lives outside of a court). We aren't living in that world anymore. From my point of view, the damage and implications and dangers will be thoroughly ignored and vehemently denied, and no one will be held accountable for any of it. I sincerely hope I'm wrong, but that just hasn't been the trajectory the world (and especially the U.S.) has been on since Y2K. If Y2K had happened today, everyone would have been screaming conspiracy theories and blaming Bill Gates and the gays and the Jews and the Mexicans and brown people and Democrats and liberals until the planes started dropping out of the sky and nuclear power plants started melting down at midnight, and then they would keep blaming Bill Gates and Jews but for not fixing the problem and manufacturing the conspiracy theories that distracted them from fixing the problems, or for crashing the planes and melting the power plants down to cover up that it was all a fake conspiracy theory or some equally stupid thing. /madman_rant"

He admits to doing it, but blames it on psychosis and claims the channel 9 news who reported on it defamed him. For those looking for the original article/video that reported on this, you can find that here. In case he tries to delete it or edit his post further: \"Edmond cybersecurity CEO accused in major hack at hospital.\" … i understand sensationalizing stories to boost user engagement and ad revenue — but let’s talk *facts*. * I was never arrested. To my surprise, i awoke to a fury of calls/text messages, asking if I was in jail. * FBI agents purportedly reached out to Griffin Media (News9) to report a warrant had been issued for my arrest. News9 defamed my character — which has caused damage to my reputation and thus loss of business revenue (exceeding $12k). * A total of (2) computers were \"accessed\". One (Computer A) was located in a waiting room next to the pharmacy — with the username and password fixated to the side of the tower. In other words, it was a guest computer designated for patients in the waiting area. * A second computer (Computer B) was accessed by wiggling the mouse, and was already logged in. As this device appeared to potentially store or transmit PHI , unlike Computer A, no software was written. * The “malware” (see attached screenshot) was written “on the fly” using software provided by publicly-accessible Computer A. PowerShell code — which takes a screenshot (visible to all in the waiting room) every 20 minutes , sent to a secure host, was set as a Scheduled Task. Endpoint was destroyed on August 7th, 2024 once screenshots of a DFIR-specific host was received. * The FBI attended a class I taught, and asked about my A.I. services to potentially be a C.I. for catching online predators (CSAM). * FBI agent Camron Borders invited me to and paid for lunch at Industry Gastro Lounge, to further discuss services. * Agents asked me to meet at their office(s), where they did not mirandize me, nor did they inform me — until mid-\"interrogation\" — that they were interested in what occurred at SSM. * Upon learning of their interest, I volunteered further details to assist in processing the incident / providing clarity. I am not \"proud\" of this occurrence, and am trusting in God and due process for the truth to be revealed. I’ve received calls for requests to interview — if you represent a media organization and want a comment/piece, feel free to reach out and be ready with CashApp/Apple Cash. ✌🏻 KOCO 5 Griffin Media KFOR Oklahoma's News 4"

He was a patient there and while there he wrote out a script in PowerShell on the machine itself (what the DFIR team is rightfully labeling and is being reported on as malware). Even if it didn't really manage to do anything to PHI, it was still a script screenshotting the desktop of the guest. No reasonable person is going to view that as an authorized activity of the hospital. Should the hospital have had that guest machine locked down more? Sure, but it doesn't change the fact that he was using the operating system in an unauthorized way, then said nothing for months nor responsibly disclosed it until the FBI caught wind of it mid-meeting with him over something else entirely. The guy knew better and he's trying to side-step it by blaming it on mental illness. While I definitely do not want to dismiss mental health issues here (Lord knows it's a problem in our industry), it feels like the way he's presenting that is him attempting to dodge accountability. If his mental illness issues are so bad that his mental faculties are compromised to the point he can't make sound judgments off-the-clock, he had no business running any kind of cybersecurity business. He simply can't be trusted. What's hilarious is the one sensible comment in his post is someone recommending a lawyer and telling him to shut the fuck up, which realistically, he really should do."

He just decided he was above that, and the shitty part is the exec team let him get away with it. We aired our grievances, we were heard, but decisions were made. The real problem though was our CFO bought into his bullshit and would go to him instead of the actual IT department about things. Turned out he fucked up everything he touched, inserted himself into tons of situations he didn't need to be in but because he knew more about everything than anybody, and also he started deciding what meetings he did and didn't feel like joining because he was in a different time zone and he didn't want to get up early.

Ford sells a car and 15 years later they are still on the hook for bad airbags (with no SnS, no subscription). Sentinel One takes down an entire airline and flights in the US like only Osama Bin Laden has accomplished before and what exactly was their consequences? How's Experian doing, LastPass, Solarwinds? The vulnerabilities being brought to their attention for quick remediation is the desired scenario. For who? For the end users/customers that's what is wanted and needed and should be inspected. For the very few companies that have to pay people to fix those bugs they'd much rather just handle that internally. They would much prefer to decide on their own how important a bug fix is. So... no. Now, if there were a true market out there the companies would be able to prove their processes and tout how secure their OS is etc.. things might be different. But, lo and behold we just got Windows 11, the OS no one asked for. Full of new bugs and holes and advertising hooks."

If Trump was willing to fire the top US spy, I can’t imagine how anyone at any three letter agency feels like right now. All my old IC coworkers mainly deal with the other nation states and they all saying it is one big shit show right now."

        "content": "Yeah, that’s not true regarding indicators. It’s exceptionally hard to get classified indicators downgraded for public consumption. It happens, but the easiest way to make it happen is to identify where the indicator has been revealed by public CTI vendors. So whatever you think you’re seeing from the IC is often only because the private sector saw it, too. It’s also important to keep in mind that the NSA isn’t allowed to operate in US infrastructure, so they’re blind to a lot of what happens there (which is why some threat actors operate exclusively in on US infrastructure). Private sector CTI vendors don’t have that restriction, so they have a much broader aperture with truly global telemetry. Yes, some former IC personnel do bring over dirty knowledge, but many take great pains to avoid cross contamination. By far, most of the publicly available indicators are organically generated by the private sector."

Most of the focus is on APT groups that CS has customers affected by (i.e the spiders and China trying to steal IP). But Russia seems to be either getting better at going undetected or isn't attacking places where CS is installed."

As a professional the person leading my security team is headed by someone who agrees with what is happening in the government. This person is thus unqualified for such a position. I have tested the water many times and there would be no way to hold these people accountable. There would absolutely be consequences to speaking up about these things as a professional. I don’t think it needs to be quite so literal for it to have power which is the problem with fascism. We’re near a point where revealing yourself publicly as a detractor is dangerous."
