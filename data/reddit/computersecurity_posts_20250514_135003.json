We found success using data transformation layers as bridges between legacy and modern systems. This lets you gradually implement ABAC without disrupting existing workflows. Always start with thorough vulnerability assessments. Document your legacy system interfaces and standardize them where possible. Then implement transformation layers that handle the security policy mappings. This approach lets you enforce consistent access policies across both old and new systems while keeping disruption minimal."
