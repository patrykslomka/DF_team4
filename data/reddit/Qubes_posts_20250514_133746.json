The biggest challenge I have using it as my daily driver is where my data lives. It tends to be siloed as I segregate my qubes down beyond ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù to ‚Äúcreative‚Äù - with apps like gimp, inkscape, etc. ‚Äúcomms‚Äù with zoom, obs, etc. ‚Äú3d‚Äù with blender, openscad, etc. and more Because of that, most of my permanent data lives in an offline data Qube and I move files in and out of that. This is still an improvement to my original daily driver which was a PC with VMWare Workstation and similarly siloed vms."

This causes the cpu to run hotter, causing throttling and also occupies cpu resource you would otherwise be able to utilise. It‚Äôs time for the community to come clean on this.

What you are describing sounds more like Xen power management issues, which are much more noticeable on laptops. When you are running multiple VMs, the cores rarely get to idle, and when they do, the hypervisor doesn't use the lower power states. This is not really a Qubes OS issue, this is just the reality of running a bare-metal hypervisor on a laptop."

Qubes is at a far end of that spectrum. Most users are better served by other solutions when they figure out they can compromise on some aspects of security and admit that they themselves are the biggest security risk, not the OS. I wish things were different. I wish sr-iov was standard on all consumer cards, if it was qubes would be a far more compelling solution to a far wider user base."

If you want your computer to only launch a ‚ÄûVM manager‚Äú / Hypervisor, look at something like Proxmox or VMware. Qubes uses Xen. In regards to your questions: Yes, there will be a performance drop. No, I don‚Äôt know what % but I have a pretty expensive Desktop and it feels pretty slow. Performance was never a priority for the developers. And honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt even try gaming on Qubes (Indie games might somewhat work). Apps will generally not care if they run in a VM.

        "content": "Hypervisors are low-level software that are designed to run multiple operating systems. They're used on everything from a laptop (VMware Workstation, etc), to giant cloud providers. Basically, instead of booting to Windows or Linux, the computer boots to the hypervisor, and then it runs lots of operating systems. Because virtual machines are strongly isolated, Qubes uses a hypervisor (Xen), to keep everything safe if a web browser or other software gets compromised. It basically tries to make the experience of using a bunch of virtual machines for security, much more pleasant. Generally the answer to the question \"should I use QubesOS\" is NO. By the time you need it, you'll know. If you're asking, it's probably not a good fit. If you are interested in trying multiple operating systems without having to reboot, why don't you try a regular virtual machine on your existing system? VMware Workstation is free for both Windows and Linux, or Windows has Hyper-V built in, and Linux has KVM/QEMU. This allows you to rapidly create & test operating system setups without having to erase things."

I would only try Indie games and even those are probably not worth the hassle. Just keep in mind that privacy and security is the main focus. If there was a way to get 1% more secure at 10% performance cost, the developers did their best to reduced it to 8% and then took the hit. It‚Äôs simply not a priority. All my windows open somewhat slow (in comparison to raw linux / windows). The start menu and launcher isn‚Äôt great, I never tried Windows and my custom keyboard won‚Äôt work at boot.

If you are not interested in diving deep into even a single one of these topics (plus some bonus topics that will pop up depending on your usage), then I recommend some caution before proceeding. The majority of support on the forums and elsewhere online is tailored towards ultra-high user security use-cases.

I've not noticed this to be a problem with the GMKtec systems I've tried, but others may know better about this specific system. As long as you can enable the CPU virtualization options (https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/installation-guide/#pre-installation) it'll probably run well. Just to clarify though, advanced GPU stuff is pretty difficult and not officially supported for almost all brands of GPU under Qubes. I assume that's what the mentioned Windows dual boot is option for though. Unfortunately on that front, strictly in terms of gaming, the system seems quite limited in several ways. Intel iGPUs are still best for low/mid range games at best, and the system does not seem to support OcuLink or even Thunderbolt in order to even hook up an external GPU to be able to handle better. If you want to to do any sort of modern AAA gaming (1080p 100+ FPS in 3D games), in general a mini PC is unfortunately a pretty bad option, with the exception of systems with a discrete GPU (Minisforum HX99g / HX100g or AceMagic Tank 03)."

I guess you can run it secure but it‚Äôs email‚Ä¶ haha. Ok, what is your simultaneous usage like? Will each appvm be active at the same time? You could easily set up a whonix gateway per persona for guaranteed isolation. each gateway will negotiate a new connection to a different tor node so those streams will not be easy to correlate at all. You will need multiple whonix gateways, not extra sys-net/sys-firewall. As you are in control o the service appvm‚Äôs, you know they are not logging internals. In your described scenario, compromise is going to happen at Thunderbird, tor browser or feather wallet. I wouldn‚Äôt run thunderbird, kleo and feather on one appvm. I‚Äôd run sys-net -sys-firewall -whonix-gateway-1 ‚Äîwhonix-desktop-1 |_tor1 |_thunderbird-1 -whonix-gateway-2 ‚Äîwhonix-desktop-tor2 |_tor2 |_thunderbird-2 -whonix-gateway-3 ‚Äîwhonix-desktop-3 |_tor3 |_thunderbird-3 debian-minimal |_kleo/gpa Keep your keys separate completely, no network. If you‚Äôre anticipating do hose thing that breaches one of your appvms where your personas are active, don‚Äôt leave keys anywhere near them.

For example, I‚Äôd have something like: Clone Whonix-Workstation-17 to make [Billy-Workstation-17 Template] ‚Äî> [Billy-Tor-App-vm]/[Billy-Kleo-APPVM] ‚Äî> [Billy-Email-APPVM] and use the same layout for each as I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs best to use different app VMs for each app I‚Äôd like to use. I don‚Äôt really plan on using more than one persona at a time, maybe two max (likely both using tor browser and MAYBE a messaging service of some sort) but overall I would be using one at a time. So you think I should do the same with the Gateways? My threat model isn‚Äôt that high, I‚Äôm not a seller or admin of a darkmarket or anything. I honestly enjoy malware analysis and enjoy looking at weird and obscure forums to find that malware. I also enjoy scam baiting, and do believe that would be where my highest risk would be associated. Not necessarily allowing anyone to connect to my machine (until I‚Äôm more comfy with it at least) but definitely talking to weird people in weird areas of the clear net / tor. I‚Äôve been using tails up until now, but that gets to be a headache to keep organized. There are times I use discord and telegram to find these people as well, so I would like that to be as low risk as I can make it (though I know it isn‚Äôt risk free, not by a long shot)"

MAC addresses have always been a non issue if you are smart. If you are on a public WiFi you just spoof it, on your home WiFi you just put whatever modem your ISP gave you into bridge mode if you don't trust it. And that if is a big if. Those things are barely scraping by with a few megs of ram and some old SPARC or more recently ARM CPU. These things are never gonna do DPI, at most they would have a backdoor to retrieve mac addresses... and if the police is invoking a backdoor on a specific router to get the MAC address it's already to late. If the ISP is a concern, like in your theory, then hosting a Tor node on their network might not be the smartest plan as you are immediately outing yourself as a Tor user, drawing attention. You can curb that by simply hosting your Tor node on some far away VPS.... but in that case you are most likely sacrificing good money OR payment info while you could just use a bridge. If instead the ISP is no concern, selfhosting a node is a great idea. You just should not connect to it. Why do that if you can just connect to a normal Tor node and still have all your traffic mixed while retaining 3 actual hops."

I actually want to try to get the most ideal whonix setup myself so any info is appreciated. Re: ISP / wifi networks, yeah I mean I know about MAC spoofing, I guess the real point is there's always going to be hardware in your route no matter what. So for instance you can use silent.link or another Monero accepting cell phone ISP, or a public wifi, but you're still at risk of hardware in between in either case. In some countries, changing the IMEI for an anon internet plan is illegal, and there's tons of analysis patterns for finding the traffic otherwise (I mean if it's a stable MVNO plan they'll get it that way no matter what usually.) And on public wifi, yeah they're not going to use DPI I agree, but even a persistent connection is still going to leave lots of traces / metadata upstream of the wifi. It's very hard to assume a user is going to a different public wifi every time, most people are gonna be on consumer ISP or an anon cell phone plan at best. So it seems summary from docs is \"there isn't a totally clear answer.\" I think I just like the idea of adding relay mostly because it generates a lot of 'false' traffic (again read the caveats in the docs...) and it also helps out the network at the same time, so it seems like a nice thing to do."

Ross Ulbricht was able to run a billion dollar marketplace while just running the Tor browser on his Ubuntu laptop? The thing that got him caught was advertising the silk road with his personal email address. You may think that surely law enforcement has become much more competent, and you'd not be wrong, but even more recent arrests barely use zero days at all, not to speak of backdoored ISPs or timing attacks through Tor. You are focusing so much on the little technical details that you lost sight of the big picture. Hope that's food for thought, and would love to hear your opinion on the matter"

        "content": "I think you might be correct. I'm a programmer and really into this stuff specifically for the technical details, but I'm less interested in the actual usage of it than just finding the right setup. I keep seeing a lot of new Tor-like networks pop up, and I've been trying to find if there's an \"ideal\" design for this -- but I'm not the intended \"end-user\", so it's most likely the wrong advice to tell someone to setup a Tor node now that I think about it if they're just trying to do silly darknet stuff. As far as what I can tell (for people who actually are into programming and want customization,) the best latest research I've seen involves using a lot of Monero VPS + multiple networks apart from Tor. Since there's new alternatives to Tor (whether or not they are 'correct' is something only time will tell.) I've specifically been looking into setting up proper wireguard proxychains + Monero VPS + Opnsense routing rules + multiple tor equivalents. I think the biggest problem I see right now, it's very difficult to have a setup that includes both a headscale/nebula/netmaker like internal VPN for your own servers, plus also supporting multiple Whonix clients, plus also dealing with multiple types of routing networks. Since there's now at least a few alternatives to Tor (especially those that require anonymous forms of payment for routing / bandwidth,) and many many anonymous VPS providers, I don't think I've yet seen a full answer as to the ideal \"standard\" deployment. There seems to be a LOT of different opinions about security models for tor vs. other networks, timing attacks, etc. etc. (every other network than them is smaller though so...) and then there's ideas related to VPS chains and what is the ideal order (i.e. using VPS chains to make multiple routes thru router networks -- or should you skip VPS entirely and never use them -- or how do you deal with running a service?) I think this is much less important for a conventional user, vs. someone trying to run an application, or a whole routing service connecting your own VPN subnet. But really, all of this stuff is typically far less important than 'conventional' opsec re: anonymity (like not doing super dumb stuff.) And then the reaity is, if you create a ton of 'noise' traffic, like self-hosting a relay, you're at risk of increased dragnet scrutiny."

Not required for persona separation unless your adversary controls or monitors guard nodes. If one persona gets popped, attacker sees only that environment. No shared circuits = no lateral correlation. Add split-GPG, split-SSH, no clipboard between VMs, etc. Bonus tip: Use qvm-prefs to restrict inter-VM communication (netvm, kernel, qrexec, etc.) And never reuse USB qubes, storage devices, or files between personas.

They are isolated and compartmentalized from each other. Qubes is not about security. Qubes is about creating an ecosystem that is entirely abstracted from the things you visually see. There is supposed to be no connection from one entity to another. In one vm you are James Bond. In another vm you are a family man. In another vm you do not allow internet access and store sensitive information. Passwords. Keys. Seeds. The cloud is someone else's computer. LastPass and WordPress have been hacked so many times they suffer from trauma. The mindset is to have 100% control, possession, ownership of the things in your life. Putting anything on the cloud means you are no longer the owner. It means a rogue employee has not been factored in. It means the unpredictable can now happen. Each vm doesn't know it has neighbors. It becomes a purely conceptual game where you architect and design what is allowed to take place and what is forbidden. VMx can print but VMy cannot. VMz has a VPN but VMq does not.

        "content": "Dev Workflows in Qubes ‚Äì The Practical Patterns Welcome aboard. You‚Äôre spot on‚ÄîQubes is brilliant for compartmentalization, but dev workflows can feel like wrestling an octopus blindfolded. The Pain You Felt? Normal. That constant TemplateVM ‚Üí install ‚Üí reboot AppVM ‚Üí something still missing ‚Üí rinse/repeat is exactly why many of us end up with hybrid workflows. You‚Äôre not alone. And you're not wrong for eyeing a StandaloneVM. In fact, here's the short version: Dev Patterns That Work in Qubes Create a dev-standalone from a trusted template Treat it like a regular dev box: install IDEs, node/npm, docker, whatever Use git, SSH, etc., as needed Bonus: Clone before major upgrades. Snapshot before stupid things. When to use: You need fluidity, not friction Your threat model is moderate You value sanity Why it works: No package juggling between template/app You can iterate without jumping through hoops Build a minimal dev-template with just your base stack (e.g., python3, npm, git, curl) Create multiple AppVMs: dev-api, dev-ui, dev-tests For volatile tools like nvm, poetry, etc.‚Äîinstall those in the AppVMs (persist in ~/) Why use this? Clean rollback (edit template ‚Üí all AppVMs benefit) Excellent isolation Ideal when dealing with untrusted or external code Downside: You‚Äôve already hit it: friction, restarts, versioning hell Create a template with everything pre-installed Fire off Disposables from it for stateless coding, testing scripts, etc. Use case: Quick PoC work Messy bash sessions Exploit testing So what do I do? Mix #1 and #2. I use a dev-standalone for daily coding and AppVMs for projects that need tighter boundaries or long-term compartmentalization. I also keep a dev-build AppVM that‚Äôs locked down, no net access, for compiling third-party stuff. Git repos are synced using qvm-copy or shared via a vault-dev VM. Disposables are reserved for quick testing of sketchy code or APIs. Final Thoughts Qubes is a toolbox, not a religion. Use the parts that work. If a StandaloneVM makes your life easier‚Äîdo it. It‚Äôs still a box within a box, and you‚Äôre still compartmentalized from your work, browser, crypto wallet, whatever. Security through usability trumps purity. Always."

Yes it's a little annoying, but you should be writing reproducible environment setup shell scripts anyways so someone else can build your env or for CI. This is entirely solvable. Note there's caveats about using qvm run pass io in dom0 etc, and better ways to handle setup, but you should just get a script that works and run it in both. The app VM will discard root changes. For instance I just run the NVM installer on both template and app VM, the env variables it installs in the app home dir persist, and the system libs persist in the template"

Do you want to leverage the security functionality of qubes for a particular threat model or is qubes just your daily driver and are struggling? I wrote some blog post long time ago on how to deploy an atlassian stack on qubes on blogger. Maybe look for it if you are interested. Principle was to install in template the basics (ie db or app server), and have the deployment done on startup in /rw/etc/ scripts (can‚Äôt remember the details it was few years back)."

        "content": "First of all, both of the other comments are wrong. Ignore them. You can't mount /dev/sdb3 directly; it's an encrypted LUKS partition. You definitely can't just mount /dev/sdb. And you have all of LVM installed, and it's not a library. LVM is kernel-level code plus some control programs. It is, however, true that giving things names like \"disk\" and \"encrypted\" can be really confusing. It looks like you have an encrypted LVM member: LVM over LUKS over a partition. The LVM volume may have other members on other devices. To assemble the volume group, LVM needs all of those members available at the same time. If the one on /dev/sdb3 is encrypted, then any others are probably also encrypted, so you have to be sure that they've all been opened (in some sense \"decrypted\") before you run the scan. There's no way to tell what other members you may have from your incomplete lsblk output. If there's really only one member, I would expect vgchange to find it... if the LUKS partition had been set up when you ran it. If you ran vgchange before you manually \"decrypted\" /dev/sdb3 to create /dev/mapper/encrypted, then vgchange wouldn't be able to find the volume. Also, my memory could be faulty and it might not know to scan LUKS pseudodevices for members. The right approach to this is to go read the documentation for LUKS and LVM (not Q-and-As, not howtos), so that you understand what's going on. Short of that, you might try pasting your whole question into an LLM, asking it for a next step, pasting back whatever output that produced, and so forth. They're actually pretty good at multistep troubleshooting. Better than trying to do back-and-forth on Reddit, anyway. If you ask either an LLM or a human for further help, you should provide the full output of lsblk, and ideally a unified, in-order log of everything you typed and the resulting output."

Disposables = zero persistence. Fix it: Create a dedicated AppVM: telegram-vm Set it to use a persistent home volume (qvm-create --class AppVM --label green --template debian-12 telegram-vm) Run Telegram in there. It‚Äôll remember your session. Bonus: Telegram's paranoia can also kick in if your IP, MAC, or hostname change too frequently.

They're a security-tool, which gives you partial privacy too. To really be private, secure and anonymous, you have to use several tools like: An onion router like TOR or I2P A hardened browser like TOR/Mullwad browser Tails, Quobes or Whonix A trusted VPN Bridges Common sense. Each one of the above tools have attack surfaces, but i think of it in terms of a swiss cheese. Every slice has holes But when you combine the slices into one big block, there's little to no permiation. For most people, who just want to not have their passwords swiped on the coffeeshop WiFI, getting fingerprinted by Canvas or ISP logging them. Mullvad and Mullvad browser should suffice. If IT-criminals or private detectives are on your ass - or if you're the private detective - adding TOR might be a good idea If your government has a national firewall or internet control - bridges, obfus8 tor/i2p, a VPN and a secure OS is probably a good idea.

        "content": "Glad you mentioned that because I was thinking that your use of Mullvad as an example of a \"perfect\" VPN had spoiled your otherwise good question. I heard recently that not only is Mullvad based in Sweden, a 14 eyes collaboration country, but that they claim that they are audited to verify that for example they don't keep logs. But the audit is apparently not fully independent and the criteria not clear. So, unfortunately, you can't trust them if they aren't independently audited, and in Sweden they are subject to police intervention like seizing equipment or logs (which may or may not exist). Sweden is also a country with very sensitive laws, so I'm guessing the police could easily get a subpoena based on things like \"posting hateful comments online\". \"Hateful\" = you called a stupid woman a \"stupid woman\" online. H/She reported you for misgendering him (he's \"a man\" undergoing metamorphosis). He's also provided a Victim Statement and wants to press charges. So the police need to speak to you about that urgently. And they'll get a dump of all your online activity from Mullvad to find other hate crimes, plus they're sure you're guilty of other stuff, because you're clearly a hateful person \"Hateful\" = you don't want more unskilled migrants to claim asylum and then feed off your tax money. Or \"Hateful\" = you don't want people from war torn countries to come to live in your country, in case they tear it apart with war like they did back home. \"Hateful\" = you don't want to pay more than 10% tax so you want the government shrunk down by 90% and you only want handouts for native citizens who paid into the system, or if their families did in previous generations if they're too young to have been able to have worked \"Hateful\" = you are a libertarian and believe that people should do things for themselves, not have a nanny or big brother government. You also prefer to think for yourself and don't agree with most of what the two or three main political parties want you to believe (big tax, big government, big business and big banks, and big mass immigration to supply cheap labour and keep everyone voting leftist so they get more free stuff). There's no escape"
