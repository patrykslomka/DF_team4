        "content": "It depends on how your work has configured their VPN settings. But the most likely answer is that they can see what websites you visit while you are connected to the VPN but probably not the details of what you viewed on a given website. VPN connections can be configured to either route ALL traffic through them or just specific traffic destined for internal company resources. There is no reliable means of guessing which your company utilizes without someone knowledgeable examining your VPN configuration and even then it may not be immediately clear. In either case it IS extremely common for work VPN connections to supply the work DNS servers as the main DNS for your PC to use. This is so that internal work resources, such as servers or workstations, can be identified and accessed using domain names such as yourPC.Company.local instead of a raw IP address such as 192.168.11.113. This also means that any DNS query while connected to the work VPN will be answered by the work DNS servers which will therefore know that you visited Amazon, Gmail and porn server XYZ. The work servers likely do not know what you searched for on Amazon or if you actually purchased anything or not, they also wouldn‚Äôt know what your emails said or even if you read any of them and finally they wouldn‚Äôt know what category of porn you looked at. There are implementations where the work servers could see more details of your activity but that would require more invasive changes to your PC which is far less likely to be done to employee personal computers even when used to telecommute. It is also possible that the work VPN does NOT provide DNS and only routes work related traffic to the VPN but this is also pretty unlikely. The only safe assumption on your part is that your work can and does know everything you do while connected to their VPN. This way you are either correct or just overly cautious."

The personal device would show a certificate warning, stating that there has been a break in the chain of trust in the certificate. If the person pays attention and doesn't proceed all is well, but a lot of people just ignore it and proceed anyway. As for logging of the IP, it also shows the domain, URL, Headers, and applies the info to application category (adult, hacking, guns, collaboration, AI, health, etc) - this may be an issue enough for some (like me) who want privacy and separation of personal vs work."

I'm not familiar with your field (eyeglasses), but it doesn't seem unreasonable that some info you touch might fall under something like this. (e.g. do you ever see/touch eye prescription information? That could easily be HIPAA info. Do you ever see payment or account info from the people who call in?) And that's not necessarily something that you'd find spelled out in a remote work doc from HR - might be in some fine-print you signed when you got hired. But the fact that this post title uses the word \"hide... from my job\" hints you already know that on some level.

My post wasn't taking a stand on the morality or ethics of it. It was an effort to help OP avoid unpleasant surprises. The original question was \"how do I hide this from my employer?\". When told \"hey that might not be a good idea\", OP replied \"but I read the remote-work doc from HR\". Like fine, glad you read that doc but if you value your job (as implied by OP trying to hide it in the first place), just be warned that having read that doc will do zero to protect you. To put it another way, what's the point of reading that doc in the first place if your determined to disregard or ignore the company's rules anyway? Just go for it."

This is actually common in corporate environments - it's called a \"split tunnel\" configuration. What this means for hiding your location: Your VPN might be hiding your general internet traffic, but the cybersecurity software is likely still reporting your actual location back to your company through its direct connection. Think of it like wearing a disguise to a party, but your friend who knows your real identity is standing right next to you the whole time, occasionally calling you by your real name. If your company really wants to know where you are, that second connection is probably giving them that information, regardless of your VPN setup."

        "content": "To be more thorough. The VPN has to be able to use the Internet connection through the ISP to build the VPN connection. Therefore, it will know what the actual IP address is of the ISP it is using. There is literally no way to stop this. However, as a Starlink user in central Illinois my POP can change from Chicago, O'Fallon, Columbus, Cincinnati and Grand Rapids all from home. In that case the obfuscation of which POP I come out of never truly reveal my true location. BTW, I only know of this problem because Fubo constantly has problems with the POP changing and then all our local channels change. They've gotten better at it, but it was pretty rampant when we first moved to Starlink. If the OP wants to avoid their company knowing where they truly are then Starlink is a viable alternative. We have been using Starlink since 2021. Both of us work from home, in IT and VPN into our corresponding networks with zero problems. I also have the Starlink Mini and use it for work/streaming on the road. If corporate were to ask me why my POP is in Hawaii, I could claim ignorance since my POP does often change even when I'm stationary in central Illinois. In addition, the public records for IP whois lookups are not accurate and for Starlink completely unreliable. I know folks stationed in Nairobi who have a POP in Minnesota and Winnipeg which is just not probable. Maybe possible with laser links between satellites but surely the Middle East would be more plausible than North America. I guess the moral of the story is Starlink provides a level of ambiguity of where the actual user is, the POP being a regional POP and not a local ISP and obfuscates true location in addition to inaccurate whois records that Starlink doesn't bother to update in a timely manner (or at all)."

        "content": "Sure. So Tailscale is a service built on top of Wireguard, a VPN software. It can be used in a number of ways one of which is called an \"exit node\". An exit node serves just as it says, an exit for all your traffic on your \"Tailnet\" (all devices on your Tailscale account). So for example, I have an exit node in Europe and in North America while in West Africa. I can manually select any of these as my exit node and appear to be at either of those locations. All without having to pay for a VPN provider. I just have Tailscale on small routers (in one instance I have it on a Raspberry Pi for the location in Europe). When I travel, I have a \"travel router\" which I connect to Internet at my travel location, turn on my Tailscale app on the router and force it to use my exit node of choice. It funnels ALL my traffic through my chosen exit node and I'm golden. There are other \"operational security\" procedures I do to ensure I'm not revealing my location. Happy to help $et thi$ up for you if intere$ted"

If the goal is simply making sure the VPN is connected and handling your traffic, instead of running a fat chromium instance just to load a DNS leak test, why not just curl to ipinfo.io? With curl user agent, it will tell you the public IP, ASN and associated info, since it's very lightweight and the free lite tier API don't have request limit, you can do it every minute if you're that paranoid. If you somehow don't trust your VPN not leaking DNS traffic (but still decide to pay for them...), dig the TXT record of whoami.ds.akahelp.net, you'll see your resolver IP, or recurse resolve yourself to get your public IP."

The answer is yes, if you're not sure how to do it check if it can easily be done before you buy. 2) No, saved passwords are on your PC and just looks at the URL. What you might find is that you are getting more captchas from Google and other sites 3) this is usually a setting in the VPN app, you can usually have it turn on automatically and have a Killswitch for if it loses connection. Manually connecting and disconnecting will be fine 99% of the time. 4) No, installed programs should be fine unless they block the VPN IP but this is more a website thing than something like Adobe. 5) the available countries entirely depends on what service you pick. As for what country is best, doesn't matter. If you want the smallest impact on speed pick your closest server. 6) again that depends. For most services while you're connected you'll have the same IP, usually if you just pick a \"best server\" option or only pick country without picking a particular server in the country it will pick whatever has the lowest load, which might be different to the one you previously picked. If your goal is anonymity you DON'T want a dedicated IP. The whole point is your traffic gets thrown in with a bunch of other people's. Why do you think you might need to sometimes change IP?"

Am I right that you have the PC connected by USB to the router (the USB port on a router is usually for a printer or storage device) and then you have the PS5 connected directly to the PC nic with an ethernet cable? That's not how any of that works."
