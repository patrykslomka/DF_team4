That said, stepping into Linux takes a little bit of work, and some people just aren't going to want to have to learn a few new things, even among privacy advocates. Plus, while most games will now work on Linux (as a Linux user I have hundreds of games I play with no trouble at all), there are some which don't and that can be a dealbreaker if you want to buy the new AAA game that has Denuvo or some garbage on it. Regardless, Microsoft has long since made it clear they don't give two shits what their users want, they're just going to keep hoovering up that data and making bigger back doors for agencies to see everything you do."

When 3.11 came out a few years later, Windows became an essential operating system that did everything it needed to do, and did it with a minimum of fuss. Over the years, Microsoft made mistakes, but they always seemed to push for the professional and polished be all end all of operating systems. As far as I'm concerned, Windows 7 was their last truly great OS. After that, they gave in to the enshittification all corporations eventually succumb to, where it became more important to maximize shareholder value at the expense of literally everything else, including the user experience. Nowadays, I don't recommend Windows to anyone."

It was my right to do it but I then had to go through a traditional pat down search which I preferred over the scan. Pat down searches are still a thing and done randomly on a daily basis. The number of times I got blowback from the TSA employees was amazing. They would often do what I call a \"reprisal search.\" They'd loudly and dramatically remove me from the area, dump all my things from a bag which was not even going to go through the body scanner and was already searched by xray, then take their time patting me down and sometimes be rough about it. Passengers in a hurry look at you like you are dirt. Each airport has a TSA site manager. Two of my friends hold these positions at different airports and they are responsible for all of TSA at their airports. They told me to not go through the chain of command next time I have an issue but to demand to see airport TSA supervisor. They have to ask for them and will fix it immediately."

It's an act of good faith in a time of very bad faith, and I've found it's received fairly well."

It's also the reason I carried it in my shirt to the airport, I thought if anything happened on the way there, everyone would know it was mine and mine alone...I think the TSA agent may have had Crocodile Dundee in her head when she told me to remember that I'm not in Australia anymore, I can't think of another reason she would have said that!"

One of the police even found my handmade 10inch machete knife (a kuriki) in the backseat and asked what I had it for, me being a dumbass just said \"because it's cool\" instead of the actual gardening related reasons I used it for but they just shrugged and put it back lol."

Net income jumped 35 per cent to $16.7bn, well above consensus estimates of $13.5bn. Meta shares were up more than 6 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday. The tech giant forecast its second-quarter revenues would be between $42.5bn and $45.5bn, with the midpoint of that range slightly higher than Wall Street’s forecast of $43.8bn. When the FTC fined them $5 billion dollars, their shares went up because they had set aside $7 billion, so they had \"saved\" $2b. Honestly, fines cannot be big enough. They need to be regulated into oblivion if the behavior actually needs to stop. If you're a drunk driver you get pulled off the road. You don't pay a fine and drive home."

I've asked moderators to pin this to the sidebar or to the top but it's never been done. Millions of Americans have privacy rights and can make request to opt out of targeted advertising, delete their data, and more, yet they have no idea. Here is a comprehensive list of all state laws that have been passed, that are currently in congress (state level), that failed to pass, and the rights all of these laws give you. It drives me crazy that we don't have any subreddit dedicated to pushing strong state privacy laws. EVERYONE wants a federal law but I can promise you that anything the federal government gives us is going to be some watered down bullshit. If your state has a bill currently in congress, READ IT AND WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE. Actually read it. Make sure it gives you the rights you want. Let them know if you think it should be stronger.

A good go-to is medical stuff. That info is intimate and protected in other aspects of our lives, but it's easy for folks to overlook the things they casually Google. E.g.

Why, you might ask would a company want to know this information? It’s not necessarily nefarious (although it can be). Let’s say you’re a laptop manufacturer, and you have a website. You’d track how users navigate through your site, to see what flows they take to eventually buy a laptop, or conversely what pages or images correlate with users closing your site and not buying a laptop. Anyway, I’m not endorsing the use of these practices, but just letting you know this type of tracking exists on basically everything you do on the internet. Also, these metrics can be used nefariously to fingerprint you (i.e. use clues to figure out your identity)."

When the stance on abortion suddenly changed in some states in the U.S., knowing who had access to the data of your period tracking app became very fucking real really fucking fast. We can't predict the future, but any data can be used as leverage currently, or in the future. Against you, or maybe another group of people. It's not about I, it's about US as as a group of people. Privacy is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting everyone, for current, and future threats. Sure, you may not be impacted today. Or maybe you're not aware of how it impacts you today. But some people are, and some people will be in the future. So yes, it may not be an immediate problem for most of people (once again, that they are aware of). So maybe the solution is to either:"

I didn't even realize it was something you needed an app for. Don't forget people operate on the mindset of it's only a problem if they are informed there's a problem.

        "content": "I think you are all thinking about this wrong, and it’s because there doesn’t seem to be any underlying principle here. Rule of law. That’s why we need privacy—full stop. Here is the rationale: If you want laws that everyone follows, and not just the oppressed, then you need democracy. Why? Because you will always have bad leadership. Always. But with democracy, you can vote them out. You can have checks and balances. To have democracy, you need privacy. You need to be able to complain without fear of reprisal. You need to be able to criticize those in power. To have privacy, you need to have it all the time, in all instances. Once you start making exceptions, you create loopholes. Once you have loopholes, those in power create laws to exploit those loopholes. Years ago, an attorney wrote a book called Three Felonies a Day. I learned about this through my work, doing research in the US court system, where a prosecutor once told me a favorite saying of prosecutors: “show me the perp and I’ll show you the crime.” That means anyone can be imprisoned if the prosecution is motivated enough. The book I was referred to, Three Felonies, describes how there are over 4000 statutes that any one of us can violate every single day—so many that we all unwittingly commit, roughly, three felonies a day, even sitting at home doing nothing. A motivated, adversarial prosecution just needs to look at all the information collected on you to create an effective case against you. This is why, as time progresses, cases against people in detention (current circumstances, for instance), become more robust: they’re on a fishing expedition through everything you’ve ever done, trying to fit your behaviors into criminal definitions. This is why your information and activities must remain private: they can be weaponized against you, ESPECIALLY if you seek to promote democratic change. I’m not saying anyone’s beliefs are right or wrong, but we all must have the right to have beliefs—even wrong ones. Once upon a time, people who disagreed with slavery were considered dissidents! Troublemakers. And history is full of examples of this. From Galileo to Martin Luther King Jr. We just do not seem to know, as a society, when we are wrong about something. (And so we need people to be free to disagree.) Edit: ultimately, “I have nothing to hide” is inane. If you believe in democracy, you have everything to hide. Innocent until proven guilty: if you believe I’m doing something illegal by being private, prove it in court."

You can't remove any part of that ID without breaking the link. On YouTube, the si parameter is your sharing incident ID that tracks you, but if you were to remove the v parameter, then the link would not work anymore because that's the video ID. Stack Overflow inserts your user ID into sharing links as part of the path, at the end. If you know what it is, you can remove it, or just know not to use the sharing buttons.

If you can prove use of your data hurt you in any way -- materially, literally, or by its manipulation -- you have recourse in the court of law. (But probably not since it will be forced into arbitration.) Current great example is automobile monitoring systems with driving data sold to Insurance Companies who use it to adjust your rates. Despite HIPPA, most of your health data is open to pharmaceutical, pharmacy benefits managers, and insurance companies. They may say this \"data is anonymized to protect PII\" but that is easily cracked with a minimum of cross referencing. Mortgage redlining is still a thing for certain classes of people."
