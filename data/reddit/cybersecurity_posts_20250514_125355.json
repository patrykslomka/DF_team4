I currently work for a FAANG company that could do it but may be somewhere else by then so we're not relying on that. As I said, this was in the works even when we thought Harris would win.

In 2020 democrats won all three again, lost it in 2022. Rarely does the presidential party that wins an election maintains that hold after. That means democrats have 2 years to get shit done. Instead they sit on their asses and then say \"well we can't do anything now\" after they lose everything. That's probably why Trump is going into turbo mode right out of the gate.

They previous two wedge issues were \"woke\" issues (defund the police, BLM, SWJ, CRT) and before that? Guns. The left kinda just kept giving up on all these issues. What's in common with all those wedge issues? The right-wing ecosystem made them into wedge issues in the first place. The left has no version of what the right does. The left doesn't have the level of billionaires bankrolling their ideological issues like the right does. So what the right does do? They make up a wedge issue, it riles up their base and they win elections. The left goes on defense, the right goes on attack until people get sick of those issues, and the right eventually makes up a new wedge issue and everyone forgets the old wedge issues cause they weren't really that important in the first place. They were just a political narrative selling point. The left continues to not have their own \"Tea Party\" movement so their own voters only show up when there's disaster to win back elections. Democrats spend years fixing the Republicans mess and by the time things are going well again, Republicans win elections and fuck it all up again. We repeat the cycle as Democrats are probably going to kill it in the midterms. The leftist voters needs to start electing more politicians with real balls like Al Franken (until he was forced out by idiots), AOC, Sanders, Van Hollen, Crockett, and Al Green and so on if they want to fight the MAGA agenda."

In case he tries to delete it or edit his post further: \"Edmond cybersecurity CEO accused in major hack at hospital.\" … i understand sensationalizing stories to boost user engagement and ad revenue — but let’s talk *facts*. * I was never arrested. To my surprise, i awoke to a fury of calls/text messages, asking if I was in jail. * FBI agents purportedly reached out to Griffin Media (News9) to report a warrant had been issued for my arrest. News9 defamed my character — which has caused damage to my reputation and thus loss of business revenue (exceeding $12k). * A total of (2) computers were \"accessed\". One (Computer A) was located in a waiting room next to the pharmacy — with the username and password fixated to the side of the tower. In other words, it was a guest computer designated for patients in the waiting area. * A second computer (Computer B) was accessed by wiggling the mouse, and was already logged in. As this device appeared to potentially store or transmit PHI , unlike Computer A, no software was written. * The “malware” (see attached screenshot) was written “on the fly” using software provided by publicly-accessible Computer A. PowerShell code — which takes a screenshot (visible to all in the waiting room) every 20 minutes , sent to a secure host, was set as a Scheduled Task. Endpoint was destroyed on August 7th, 2024 once screenshots of a DFIR-specific host was received. * The FBI attended a class I taught, and asked about my A.I. services to potentially be a C.I. for catching online predators (CSAM). * FBI agent Camron Borders invited me to and paid for lunch at Industry Gastro Lounge, to further discuss services. * Agents asked me to meet at their office(s), where they did not mirandize me, nor did they inform me — until mid-\"interrogation\" — that they were interested in what occurred at SSM. * Upon learning of their interest, I volunteered further details to assist in processing the incident / providing clarity. I am not \"proud\" of this occurrence, and am trusting in God and due process for the truth to be revealed. I’ve received calls for requests to interview — if you represent a media organization and want a comment/piece, feel free to reach out and be ready with CashApp/Apple Cash. ✌🏻 KOCO 5 Griffin Media KFOR Oklahoma's News 4"

No reasonable person is going to view that as an authorized activity of the hospital. Should the hospital have had that guest machine locked down more? Sure, but it doesn't change the fact that he was using the operating system in an unauthorized way, then said nothing for months nor responsibly disclosed it until the FBI caught wind of it mid-meeting with him over something else entirely. The guy knew better and he's trying to side-step it by blaming it on mental illness. While I definitely do not want to dismiss mental health issues here (Lord knows it's a problem in our industry), it feels like the way he's presenting that is him attempting to dodge accountability. If his mental illness issues are so bad that his mental faculties are compromised to the point he can't make sound judgments off-the-clock, he had no business running any kind of cybersecurity business. He simply can't be trusted. What's hilarious is the one sensible comment in his post is someone recommending a lawyer and telling him to shut the fuck up, which realistically, he really should do."

These companies want to pump out new versions and code, that's cheap. Fixing and securing that code isn't. It's been proven repeatedly that no one is going to hold them accountable. Ford sells a car and 15 years later they are still on the hook for bad airbags (with no SnS, no subscription). Sentinel One takes down an entire airline and flights in the US like only Osama Bin Laden has accomplished before and what exactly was their consequences? How's Experian doing, LastPass, Solarwinds? The vulnerabilities being brought to their attention for quick remediation is the desired scenario. For who? For the end users/customers that's what is wanted and needed and should be inspected. For the very few companies that have to pay people to fix those bugs they'd much rather just handle that internally. They would much prefer to decide on their own how important a bug fix is. So... no. Now, if there were a true market out there the companies would be able to prove their processes and tout how secure their OS is etc.. things might be different. But, lo and behold we just got Windows 11, the OS no one asked for. Full of new bugs and holes and advertising hooks."

I think you might be trying to argue about a CISSP concept that is to say \"the mindset of a CISO\" but again, you're really talking about risk management and strategy there, which sure they're elements of security, but they're non technical elements of security. You can get to that role solely from a GRC standpoint which is purely analytical and requires no technical knowledge of technology. Doesn't make IT stuff NOT security just because GRC is.

I don’t care much about the IT part here, that’s what you’re missing. I’m sure you can retrain senior IT folk to do technical security roles and they’ll do them well. I’ve seen a lot of those transitions before and they’re good at the technical bit. But push them on the core principles of security and they’ll crumble.

I've seen a number of arguments between \"LinkedIn influencers\" in the security domains sparking up because of a disagreement between a British person and American person not agreeing on terminology. I suspect that a lot of our disagreement stems from that. I think you're misinterpreting my meaning. People - especially people from the US in IT already - often think that \"pivoting\" from IT to cybersecurity means they have to start over from entry level because it's a different career silo. I'm saying that the silos overlap. Because they do. So you don't have to jump over and start at the bottom. And the level of confidence you have that technical IT folks struggle with core security principles tells me that you either aren't in a leadership role or suck at leadership, because if you can't train a technical person on the core principles of security, you really can't train anyone to do anything and shouldn't be in charge of developing a team."

There are two issues as I see it, first the fundamentals are not taught -we teach how to use software not what the software is doing and how it is doing it. As a result when things don't work as expected they sit there with a blank stare on their faces not knowing what to do. Second, we don't teach people how to trouble shoot, I don't think it's exclusive to recent hires I just think it's more common. Trouble shooting is something that can be taught, it's not hard it's just a process but for whatever reason it's not part of the educational process. To a certain degree I think we've used google as a crutch for so long we can't figure something out for ourselves, it's great to get the answer in 3 seconds but what do you do when google doesn't know."

I’m a very hands on IT director. If some new problem comes where there is no obvious solution for, I roll up sleeves and get to work on it. It’s the best part of being in tech. But that’s my mindset. Fewer and fewer people I’ve interviewed have demonstrated that mindset. They literally can’t do it. I remember one time our marketing department wanted to direct hire a developer for a big website project they had. The guy they hired was extremely talented using the laravel framework for PHP. But outside of that specifically, he could do nothing else. Straight PHP. Nope. Command line stuff. Nope. Simple workstation troubleshooting. Nope. Outside of Laravel he literally had 0 skills with anything else IT related. So he was basically an end-user that my team had to support with even the most basic tech issues. And then there are the cert maniacs. I don’t care what certs you have. I care about your creative problem solving skills, because if you have those you can solve anything. They know the answers they needed to know to pass the cert exam, but they fall apart when given a real world situation with that tech area."

It is constantly changing at least on the level that higher ups demand things work a certain way. The documentation is constantly changing. Newer forms for every process involved etc... Personally, I pity anyone working in IT. It's a thankless job and I would not recommend anyone pursuing a career in that at all. That's just me though. I recommend becoming database administrator.

Zero applicable experience. But they are sharp as a tack, have a drive to learn, and not a hint of a technical ego. In less then a year they've gotten fully up to speed and are putting in quality work. And it's not just him. We have another success story in a former firefighter, and another in a former accountant.

We already have a CVE in progress and appreciate the heads up.” And that would’ve been the basic level of effort. So that means he went out of his way to be a jerk. Not a good look."

IT was already testing/assessing the patches, but they were quite new still, and they were following standard testing cycle. I know of a few companies where IT chose to use CrushFTP. Personally would never have been my choice."
