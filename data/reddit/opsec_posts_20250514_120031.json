Here are some questions I have: 1) What router were you thinking of? Do you need WiFI? What LAN speeds are you targeting? 2) Why 3 different workstations, and not compartmentalize using VMs? 3) What Server for the backup solution? Custom or some NAS? What software to do the actual backup? 4) It sounds like you want to use the Server for access control. Why not consolidate and simply use VLANS on the router level to segment the network? 5) If you are trying to defend against corporate surveillance, not using big-tech products and blocking their services with something like a PI-Hole or Unbound tends to be sufficient with a network-wide VPN also being a good option. Why the need for multiple firewalls if you can DNS filter?"

        "content": "> Questions. Is this redundant? If this is not redundant, what can I do to improve this setup? What advice do you have? It's somewhat redundant, but sometimes redundancy is not a bad thing at all. If I try to think along your line of reasoning (with two firewalls, in case one fails), then I would probably setup something as follows. Blocking all but strictly necessary incoming traffic should be the default, but you could even block all outgoing traffic except to specific destinations, if the necessary traffic is fairly limited in scope. This can also be different per workstation. For WAN you could differentiate per workstation as well, based on needs/threat model. Just as an example: you could route one workstation through Tor, one through a VPN and one through your regular ISP connection. Make sure to add the specifics per workstation to your threat model so you know what mitigations are needed. DNS is a big can of worms. You say you want to thwart/undermine corporate surveillance as much as possible and ideally also limit government surveillance. Both aren't easy. For protecting yourself from general/wholesale corporate surveillance, you could block all offending domains (in DNS) and IPs (firewall) based on blocklists and disable JavaScript in your browser. Even then IP addresses, browser user agents and account logins/sessions (and possibly anything you do while being logged in) can be added to profiles made about you. So you would also need to be careful where/how/if you login (which is behavior and not technical) and what outgoing IP address you use (ISP, Tor, VPN etc.) to the clearnet. But for truly targeted corporate and government surveillance it's not as easy. There are many strategies and some of them are polar opposites. DNS caching vs. non-caching. Your own recursor vs. a public one (and if public, which one can be trusted...). DoT vs DoH vs DoQ. Most blocklists vs no blocklists vs. some blocklists. DNS over Tor or not. Tor vs VPN vs something else. DNS record TTL manipulation or not. And there are many more considerations with DNS if you need to protect yourself against targeted surveillance. And even then, the perfect solutions doesn't exist. All options/methods/setups have clear disadvantages. Fortunately, most people aren't targeted this way, so in that sense this will not be part of their threat model. You could run DNS on your router/firewall or firewall server, for example a DNS server per VLAN/subnet or run one for all VLAN/subnets together. You could also run it on dedicated hardware so it is harder to manipulate when the router/firewall or firewall gets hacked. DNS doesn't use much resources, so even a cheap single board computer will most likely be able to provide your DNS (including blocklists and stuff). And finally: - Make sure any IPMI/iDRAC/iLO/console are on a completely separate network with a dedicated router, if you don't want an exploit in your router/firewall to result in adversaries getting access. - Make sure your opsec also extends to the workstation itself. In the end, there is only so much a firewall (or multiple firewalls) can do. Hope this helps!"

The payment included billing info — which probably included your friend's real email (or at least was linked to a profile that did). Many virtual card services (even privacy-focused ones) still tie back to the user's legal identity, email, and phone. VPS providers often log everything, including payment metadata. Even if you didn’t enter the email manually, the payment processor might have auto-filled it from your bank’s record."

Also if the password manager is protected by a password and that password gets keylogged then if the attacker has access to the encrypted files and reverse engineered the decryption process of your version of the password manager software, then they can decrypt all your passwords. Honestly the best password manager is your brain its not hackable and cant be reverse engineered so maybe the real question is how secure is your own memory and how much do you trust it with your sensitive info. keep in mind this is assuming the worst possible threat model that is extremely unlikely to happen, but opsec is all about what ifs and scenarios where everything is just right that lets someone exploit your privacy."
