Guides and tutorials are welcome here as long as they are suitably complex and most importantly legal! Bans are handed out at moderator discretion. Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. \"Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal\", \"Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering\"... Damn kids. They're all alike. Keep it legal Hacking can be a grey area but keep it above board. Discussion around the legality of issues is ok, encouraging or aiding illegal activities is not We are not your personal army. This is not the place to try to find hackers to do your dirty work and you will be banned for trying. This includes: No \"how do i start hacking?\" posts. See /r/howtohack or the stickied post. Intermediate questions are welcomed - e.g. \"How does HSTS prevent SSL stripping?\" is a good question. \"How do I hack wifi with Kali?\" is bad. No \"I got hacked\" posts unless it's an interesting post-mortem of a unique attack. Your nan being phished doesn't count. Sharing of personal data is forbidden - no doxxing or IP dumping Spam is strictly forbidden and will result in a ban. Professional promotion e.g. from security firms/pen testing companies is allowed within the confines of site-wide rules on self promotion found here, but will otherwise be considered spam.

The truth is there are likely 5 extremely good hackers on Earth. There is another tier of mindblowingly good (not quite as the top 5), but pretty much can do whatever they want, and then there's a variation among the rest. The thing that will always provide job security is that those who don't understand our work, are not even close in terms of being able to provide discomfort. They actually will eat themselves up as they take on more and more and the weight of their mistakes will always crush them. Keep on tokin' and keep on mowin' -- shit is what the world really needs!"

        "content": "Depends on what the idea of hacking is. For most it's that of curiosity for others, it's the idea of remote control. Networking is a basic. What ports and services are. Run a server and connect to it. Not hack but merely understand what happens in the background. It's all fine saying I want to hack a website I built but not knowing what a web server is or the fact that there are several variations and different operating systems. Same goes for FTP, SSH, Telnet, SQL etc. Knowing that I setup X FTP server and realising that there are default credentials. Devices everywhere from routers, switches, CCTV, Printers, HVAC, PLC, and even something running the HTCPCP/1.0 protocol has default credentials that will open another gate into that rabbit hole or learning how that particular device works and how you can bend it to your will with various techniques. The rest is mindset. One key doesn't fit all. Knowing how things work and how to use your tools. I often wonder if there are machines active on port 27374."

Also you can install virtual machines with intentional vulnerabilities to safely practice hacking, or use a web site that provides vulnerable applications for learning like https://www.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker101 You can do bug bounties, which are legal pentesting where you get paId if you find a vulnerability on certain websites. Here is what Brave's Leo says about virtual machines: Prompt: virtual machine with vulternable apps for hacking To practice hacking and penetration testing, you can use virtual machines (VMs) that are intentionally vulnerable. These VMs provide a safe environment for testing and learning about security vulnerabilities without risking damage to real systems. Here are some options:"

        "content": "Precisely. I will share my mindset with the world because I believe hacking is becoming a deprecated practice because of its negative connotations associated with crime. How I understand it, “hacking” is understanding how (whatever you want to manipulate) operates. Once you have a clear understanding, then you can begin exploitation without going in completely blind. If you don’t really understand what you’re trying to manipulate, there’s no chance. I know there’s a plethora tools available, but what’s the point of using the suites if you really have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes? I’m talking about automatic tools (a certain framework).. There are no shortcuts, you simply need a vast understanding. Try to specialize and learn the ins and outs completely of that one thing and move onto something else. Use the knowledge from your specialization and apply it to your new area of study. And fill in the blanks. Repeat until you can do it all. Also, ChatGPT is great for breaking down the finer points of extremely complicated topics (machine code/reverse engineering). You must be deeply passionate and curious about these topics or it gets frustrating very quickly! Consume everything in small chunks so you don’t get overwhelmed. Practice newly acquired knowledge to solidify and understand the concept — you only remember about 10% of what you read, so solidify it immediately by practicing, if possible. Don’t use your super powers to cause damage!"
