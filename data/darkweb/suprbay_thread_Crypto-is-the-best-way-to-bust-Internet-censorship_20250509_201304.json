        "content": "Financial institutions are increasingly being leveraged as tools for internet censorship and content control. By exerting pressure on payment processors and banking partners, governments and regulatory bodies can effectively cut off funding to individuals or organizations whose content they deem objectionable. This tactic has been used to target a wide range of entities, including independent journalists, alternative media outlets, and even social media platforms. By limiting access to financial services, these institutions can effectively silence dissenting voices and restrict the diversity of content available online, ultimately undermining the principles of free speech and open discourse on the internet. Crypto can be likened to cash on the internet due to its decentralized nature and pseudonymous transactions. Just as physical cash allows for direct, peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks, cryptocurrencies enable users to send funds directly to one another without the involvement of financial institutions. Additionally, like cash, crypto transactions can be relatively anonymous, with users able to conduct transactions without disclosing personal information. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies offer a level of privacy and autonomy similar to cash. Users have control over their funds without the need for a central authority, which aligns with the principles of financial freedom and self-sovereignty. This can be particularly advantageous in regions where traditional banking services are inaccessible or unreliable, as cryptocurrencies provide an alternative means of accessing and transferring funds. In essence, cryptocurrencies embody the ethos of cash in the digital age, offering users a decentralized, borderless, and private form of currency.",

I've yet to find a useful service that doesnt require me to to scan my passport before proceeding The world government has been a real bastard and they've got a ton of KYC (Know your client) rules. So for someone like you, you set up an account with coinbase which ties into normal bank account Then setup a 2nd wallet with something like exodus which ties to into nothing. When you want 110% anonymisation, you just transfer your money from your coinbase wallet to your exodus wallet. Then you buy whatever you want with your exodus wallet. There are other ways without having to use something like coinbase. I only have one wallet and most often I just get people to pay me in crypto. Or, I'll do a P2P trade with someone. This way I avoid all the rules and government bullshit.",

        "content": "Financial institutions are increasingly being leveraged as tools for internet censorship and content control. By exerting pressure on payment processors and banking partners, governments and regulatory bodies can effectively cut off funding to individuals or organizations whose content they deem objectionable. This tactic has been used to target a wide range of entities, including independent journalists, alternative media outlets, and even social media platforms. By limiting access to financial services, these institutions can effectively silence dissenting voices and restrict the diversity of content available online, ultimately undermining the principles of free speech and open discourse on the internet. Crypto can be likened to cash on the internet due to its decentralized nature and pseudonymous transactions. Just as physical cash allows for direct, peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks, cryptocurrencies enable users to send funds directly to one another without the involvement of financial institutions. Additionally, like cash, crypto transactions can be relatively anonymous, with users able to conduct transactions without disclosing personal information. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies offer a level of privacy and autonomy similar to cash. Users have control over their funds without the need for a central authority, which aligns with the principles of financial freedom and self-sovereignty. This can be particularly advantageous in regions where traditional banking services are inaccessible or unreliable, as cryptocurrencies provide an alternative means of accessing and transferring funds. In essence, cryptocurrencies embody the ethos of cash in the digital age, offering users a decentralized, borderless, and private form of currency.",

I've yet to find a useful service that doesnt require me to to scan my passport before proceeding The world government has been a real bastard and they've got a ton of KYC (Know your client) rules. So for someone like you, you set up an account with coinbase which ties into normal bank account Then setup a 2nd wallet with something like exodus which ties to into nothing. When you want 110% anonymisation, you just transfer your money from your coinbase wallet to your exodus wallet. Then you buy whatever you want with your exodus wallet. There are other ways without having to use something like coinbase. I only have one wallet and most often I just get people to pay me in crypto. Or, I'll do a P2P trade with someone. This way I avoid all the rules and government bullshit.",
