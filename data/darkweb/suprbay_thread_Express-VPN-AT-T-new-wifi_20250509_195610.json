        "content": "At&t wants me to stop using a landline for my internet service and start using their new Wifi, AT&T internetair. My question is, will I still be protected by my Express VPN, I use it mostly for this site, especially since a lot of the sites I go to don't seem to like it and will not allow me entry. I have read where it may not be as fast, anyone have experience with it. Good or bad? My curret speeds as measured by Ookla are download-6.36 Mbps and upload-.64 Mbps, this is in the morning with Express VPN running. Thanks for your time",
