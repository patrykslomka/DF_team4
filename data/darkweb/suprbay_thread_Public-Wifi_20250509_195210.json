But I dont usually camo at one spot or use one public one all the time. But yeah I know it can mess them up and also restrict for future guests and hog bandwith. I always wondered....

You might end up getting that resource restricted. Cheers Oof. I didnt think of that. I mean it does let me download 1tb a month at minimum. Tv shows and movies that I put on my NAS and jellyfin. But I dont usually camo at one spot or use one public one all the time. But yeah I know it can mess them up and also restrict for future guests and hog bandwith. I always wondered.... Do businesses get DMCA complaints and can their ISP suspend their internet from mass torrenting and piracy? >_<",
