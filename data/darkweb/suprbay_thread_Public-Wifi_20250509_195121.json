(no vpn) Most of the public wifi actually do allow torrent just throttle the speed but also some actually have great speed and i reached 12 mbps. But mostly just wondering if its ok to torrent on public wifi as we all know the owner takes the hit with DMCA and stuff but like morally.... I mean like it is open wifi and they dont block it...",

But I dont usually camo at one spot or use one public one all the time. But yeah I know it can mess them up and also restrict for future guests and hog bandwith. I always wondered....

You might end up getting that resource restricted. Cheers Oof. I didnt think of that. I mean it does let me download 1tb a month at minimum. Tv shows and movies that I put on my NAS and jellyfin. But I dont usually camo at one spot or use one public one all the time. But yeah I know it can mess them up and also restrict for future guests and hog bandwith. I always wondered.... Do businesses get DMCA complaints and can their ISP suspend their internet from mass torrenting and piracy? >_<",
