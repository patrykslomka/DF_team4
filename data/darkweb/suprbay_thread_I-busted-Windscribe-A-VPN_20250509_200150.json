        "content": "If do hold the truth, roll with it worldwide by the media. Action. If not, not. Simple. Hardware's ID, as in \" /etc/machine-id ,\" that is unique, is never \"obfuscated\" by the VPN per se, and this is never sent on the Internet irregardless. And replacing the IP/MAC addresses is the usual feature of any router or Internet hardware and it cannot be efficiently used for identification (see: NAT) in most cases without MiTM hardware on many levels plus access to the target's ISP, like it's in my country. Neither a VPN touches a browser's user agent or what a 3rd party JavaScript may use for your unique hardware identification. Why was it ever assumed, on what basis? Like, every connection to Suprbay is encrypted, a VPN does not change anything in this regard, this is the domain of a browser: The site can easily identify you. By the very criteria every VPN is \"utter garbage.\" So, well, how can anybody be confident that the \"busting\" claim itself if not a mistake then? The point. If you want to try to address the core point, don't play the \"I think you are desperately\" tune, it's inefficient. Do tackle the point itself. Check, verify, observe. Since you reject to provide a better context or the way to replicate with 100% result, nothing can be done in the forum's framework to assure the wider public in the truthfulness of the claim. So far it doesn't seem to have a strong foundation to be trustworthy or verifiable from a 3rd party standpoint. My own expectation on that is the topic will not evolve, no data will be provided to confirm for sure, then it'll be forgotten like billions of other topics on the wider Internet. Life, life will go on as usual.",

        "content": "If do hold the truth, roll with it worldwide by the media. Action. If not, not. Simple. Hardware's ID, as in \" /etc/machine-id ,\" that is unique, is never \"obfuscated\" by the VPN per se, and this is never sent on the Internet irregardless. And replacing the IP/MAC addresses is the usual feature of any router or Internet hardware and it cannot be efficiently used for identification (see: NAT) in most cases without MiTM hardware on many levels plus access to the target's ISP, like it's in my country. Neither a VPN touches a browser's user agent or what a 3rd party JavaScript may use for your unique hardware identification. Why was it ever assumed, on what basis? Like, every connection to Suprbay is encrypted, a VPN does not change anything in this regard, this is the domain of a browser: The site can easily identify you. By the very criteria every VPN is \"utter garbage.\" So, well, how can anybody be confident that the \"busting\" claim itself if not a mistake then? The point. If you want to try to address the core point, don't play the \"I think you are desperately\" tune, it's inefficient. Do tackle the point itself. Check, verify, observe. Since you reject to provide a better context or the way to replicate with 100% result, nothing can be done in the forum's framework to assure the wider public in the truthfulness of the claim. So far it doesn't seem to have a strong foundation to be trustworthy or verifiable from a 3rd party standpoint. My own expectation on that is the topic will not evolve, no data will be provided to confirm for sure, then it'll be forgotten like billions of other topics on the wider Internet. Life, life will go on as usual.",

I was just talking to the manger of the business and he told me that they got a copyright strike for what I downloaded. So unless someone else was also downloading the same programs... I think it's safe to assume that Windscribe is keeping logs and sharing information Did you forget to turn on \"Firewall\" mode (blocks traffic if/when the VPN may drop)... if not, then the brief moment the traffic switched, could be enough to set off the copyright trolls",
