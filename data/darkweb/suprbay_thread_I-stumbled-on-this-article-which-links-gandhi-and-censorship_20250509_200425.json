        "content": "Another load of crap. Pornographers were never fighting for the freedom of speech. Pornographers were fighting for the right to be perverts and make money by being perverts and God bless them for that. So, that article was written by Hamilton Steele? Holy shit! I figured he died from aids or an aggressive form of gonorrhea! Guy was just hiding in France making hairy arm pit smut films? Ha! Anyway. The freedom of speech is just the catch all argument for doing whatever the fuck you want to do and the second someone stops you from what you are doing you cry wolf and that someone is censoring you! So what does Ghandi have to do with porn and censorship? Not a fucking thing. What does he have to do with mind control? Fucking everything! Ghandi convinced millions of Indians to sit around and do nothing as a form of protest and what happened? Their British enslavers starved them to death. True story. In WWII, Ghandi wanted independence for India. Britain said India could have independence if they fought against the Axis. The Axis wanted to defeat the British in India. So the Indian National Army fought on the side of the Axis. Now we have two key players: Ghandi, opposed the British by convincing people to resist by doing nothing and at the same time, convinced Indians to fight for the British. Bose, opposed the British by convincing people to resist the occupation and at the same time, convinced Indians to fight against the British. Now, I'm not a huge fan of the Axis but I'm not a huger fan of the British. We have been led to believe that Ghandi was a source of peaceful resistance and harmony when in reality he was racist, tried to force his life style (religious, sexual, etc) onto his followers. Even as the British caused millions of Indian deaths from starvation , Ghandi did nothing while Bose fought them. During the end of WWII, the British didn't want Japan to be able to steal food from Bangladesh so they simply stopped sending food to Bangladesh and let them starve. So, it's easy to say that Ghandi convinced these people to participate in a hunger strike and that's why they died and India received it's independence but It's more honest to say that as the Indians became violent and fought against the British is more truthful and promising them freedom in return for cooperation is how India gained it's freedom.",

        "content": "Another load of crap. Pornographers were never fighting for the freedom of speech. Pornographers were fighting for the right to be perverts and make money by being perverts and God bless them for that. So, that article was written by Hamilton Steele? Holy shit! I figured he died from aids or an aggressive form of gonorrhea! Guy was just hiding in France making hairy arm pit smut films? Ha! Anyway. The freedom of speech is just the catch all argument for doing whatever the fuck you want to do and the second someone stops you from what you are doing you cry wolf and that someone is censoring you! So what does Ghandi have to do with porn and censorship? Not a fucking thing. What does he have to do with mind control? Fucking everything! Ghandi convinced millions of Indians to sit around and do nothing as a form of protest and what happened? Their British enslavers starved them to death. True story. In WWII, Ghandi wanted independence for India. Britain said India could have independence if they fought against the Axis. The Axis wanted to defeat the British in India. So the Indian National Army fought on the side of the Axis. Now we have two key players: Ghandi, opposed the British by convincing people to resist by doing nothing and at the same time, convinced Indians to fight for the British. Bose, opposed the British by convincing people to resist the occupation and at the same time, convinced Indians to fight against the British. Now, I'm not a huge fan of the Axis but I'm not a huger fan of the British. We have been led to believe that Ghandi was a source of peaceful resistance and harmony when in reality he was racist, tried to force his life style (religious, sexual, etc) onto his followers. Even as the British caused millions of Indian deaths from starvation , Ghandi did nothing while Bose fought them. During the end of WWII, the British didn't want Japan to be able to steal food from Bangladesh so they simply stopped sending food to Bangladesh and let them starve. So, it's easy to say that Ghandi convinced these people to participate in a hunger strike and that's why they died and India received it's independence but It's more honest to say that as the Indians became violent and fought against the British is more truthful and promising them freedom in return for cooperation is how India gained it's freedom.",
