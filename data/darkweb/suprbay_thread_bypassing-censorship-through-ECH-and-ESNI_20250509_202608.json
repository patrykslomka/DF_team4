        "content": "A lot of isps use deep package inspection to block websites access to sites like the piratebay.org as addition to blocking on DNS level. They look into the SNI to see which websites you visit and to block them. Programs like powertunnel Have several tricks to spoof the SNI to bypass the censorship. See for example . But it has a lot of downsides like breaking websites and I have a very hard time installing it. A while back cloudflare wrote a blog about ECH( ) as continuation on ESNI. Both techniques that made it possible to bypass censorships of ISPs integrated in for example firefox. Its useful. See for example where a Reddit user is trying to use those techniques which is very cool. Unfortunately those techniques are dying out due to lack of support of websites. Does the piratebay support ECH or ESNI(meaning that the website does not crash if you enabled this in a browser)? If anyone could hep me out with using a browser that supports ECH/ESNI and help me out to succesfully load the piratebay I would be interested and if anyone could help me out wit correctly configuring powertunnel(on windows or android) to load the piratebay I would also be interested. I do not wish to use a vpn",
