I keep trying to install 'free' VPNs but they are not really free- they always want me to sign up with a credit card for a trial which I would later cancel before the.. well you get the idea. The only one I found so far was Express VPN but the free trial expired. Any ideas appreciated. thanks. Windscribe is a cool VPN, 10GB free if you verify ur email. It doesn't require entering card details, despite having premium options available",
