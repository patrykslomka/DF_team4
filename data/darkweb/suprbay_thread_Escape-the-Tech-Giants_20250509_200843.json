I don't lack any freedoms, none at all. Have no idea what you're talking about. My Windows computing has all the freedoms in the world. As a Windows user, I agree with all of this. I DON'T know how to program and my computing can be quite lazy. RYP is probably the same way but won't admit it. BUT, Windows \"freedoms\" to me just equate to \"ease of use and accessibility\", which are not truly free. They seem that way because everything I want to do is right here... I guess there are different levels of freedoms depending on individual use. This is all the freedom I need for what I do (but again, even I prefer Firefox and VLC over what Windows provides). If I was a programmer, or if I was smarter enough to do more with my computer than my current capabilities, I'd probably appreciate Linux and open source codes more. If there is a limitation than Linux can't do that windows can, the beauty would be that Linux can be programmed somehow TO fill that gap... Just my thoughts from my level of experience.",

I DON'T know how to program and my computing can be quite lazy. RYP is probably the same way but won't admit it. BUT, Windows \"freedoms\" to me just equate to \"ease of use and accessibility\", which are not truly free. They seem that way because everything I want to do is right here... I guess there are different levels of freedoms depending on individual use. This is all the freedom I need for what I do (but again, even I prefer Firefox and VLC over what Windows provides). If I was a programmer, or if I was smarter enough to do more with my computer than my current capabilities, I'd probably appreciate Linux and open source codes more. If there is a limitation than Linux can't do that windows can, the beauty would be that Linux can be programmed somehow TO fill that gap... Just my thoughts from my level of experience. Nah you just lazy. Nowadays you can get a linux distro that works out of the box. Installation is easier and comfier than windows. VLC and Firefox or Chromium are bundled by default. No need to mess with drivers for your printer or network card. Everything just werks™. No need to worry about sudden updates shutting down your workflow for hours. You are prompted to agree before updating, and you can work while its updating. You are just LZAZY back when I joined up in 2013, I put my name in a Wu-Tang Clan name generator and it came up with: LaZyAssed Destroyer... I took LZA to be like GZA and RZA... So calling me lazy couldn;t be more spot on!",

I DON'T know how to program and my computing can be quite lazy. RYP is probably the same way but won't admit it. BUT, Windows \"freedoms\" to me just equate to \"ease of use and accessibility\", which are not truly free. They seem that way because everything I want to do is right here... I guess there are different levels of freedoms depending on individual use. This is all the freedom I need for what I do (but again, even I prefer Firefox and VLC over what Windows provides). If I was a programmer, or if I was smarter enough to do more with my computer than my current capabilities, I'd probably appreciate Linux and open source codes more. If there is a limitation than Linux can't do that windows can, the beauty would be that Linux can be programmed somehow TO fill that gap... Just my thoughts from my level of experience. Nah you just lazy. Nowadays you can get a linux distro that works out of the box. Installation is easier and comfier than windows. VLC and Firefox or Chromium are bundled by default. No need to mess with drivers for your printer or network card. Everything just werks™. No need to worry about sudden updates shutting down your workflow for hours. You are prompted to agree before updating, and you can work while its updating. You are just LZAZY back when I joined up in 2013, I put my name in a Wu-Tang Clan name generator and it came up with: LaZyAssed Destroyer... I took LZA to be like GZA and RZA... So calling me lazy couldn;t be more spot on!",

But nowadays you can play most gaymes on linux with a steam account- if you into that. Me I love me some CDDA which is 100% open sauce and free as in freedom, runs on my rapsberry pi 4b, and I am a total boss at it BTW I have played a few games. I like how Windows is made by the same company Xbox is, so I used my old controller as it is just a USB port. I get that Microsoft made Xbox, but any controller just works under Linux so fun!",
