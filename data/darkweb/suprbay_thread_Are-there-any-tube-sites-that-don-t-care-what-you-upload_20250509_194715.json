You could anonymously buy some cheap seedbox and host it from there then share links via your social profiles. But of course not many people will be willing to download additional software to watch a stream... EDIT: There are Firefox addons that will (supposedly) stream torrents but I didn't test it. Another way is to host it on your own tube site by using some freely available software like WebTorrent and some cheap VPS that would handle your audience demand. In any of this ways you lose easy reach for new audience, I guess it's the price you'll have to pay for total freedom. Maybe DTube ? Even if they \"remove\" or rather delist it from the site, the link will still work as long as you seed or others are seeding it but I can't really advice you here as I did not test it yet. Another similar concept is Theta, but again - I did not test it my self so can't really tell you anything.",

I'm going to sound like a negative bitch who just wants to shoot down everyone's ideas. But, I'm not trying to do that. I'm just looking for a practical solution that will work. Here's the problem. 99% of the general public are morons who refuse to learn anything new. Anything that requires downloading, addons or more than a \"tap to play\" will chase away the majority. The other problem is that 80% of all web traffic is mobile phone. So, everything kind of has to be a responsive clone of youtube or has an app. The easiest solution is to find a tube site that doesn't give a damn what they host. But, that's easier said than done So, I'll look at Dtube and I'll see what I find.",

Everything take time and thanks for keeping me updated. I've been all over D.tube for the past few hours. The platform is a complete mess. For example, I understand what it's attempting to do but having to use 3rd party platforms to sign up isn't too smart. D.tube feels like a site designed by paranoid and delusional conspiracy theorists. I may have other projects that I'll be able to use the platform. But, what I'm currently working on it's just not convenient.",

        "content": "If you really don't want any restrictions (aside from CP) then maybe your audience could use a streaming software for torrents like \"WebTorrent Desktop\". You could anonymously buy some cheap seedbox and host it from there then share links via your social profiles. But of course not many people will be willing to download additional software to watch a stream... EDIT: There are Firefox addons that will (supposedly) stream torrents but I didn't test it. Another way is to host it on your own tube site by using some freely available software like WebTorrent and some cheap VPS that would handle your audience demand. In any of this ways you lose easy reach for new audience, I guess it's the price you'll have to pay for total freedom. Maybe DTube ? Even if they \"remove\" or rather delist it from the site, the link will still work as long as you seed or others are seeding it but I can't really advice you here as I did not test it yet. Another similar concept is Theta, but again - I did not test it my self so can't really tell you anything.",

You could anonymously buy some cheap seedbox and host it from there then share links via your social profiles. But of course not many people will be willing to download additional software to watch a stream... EDIT: There are Firefox addons that will (supposedly) stream torrents but I didn't test it. Another way is to host it on your own tube site by using some freely available software like WebTorrent and some cheap VPS that would handle your audience demand. In any of this ways you lose easy reach for new audience, I guess it's the price you'll have to pay for total freedom. Maybe DTube ? Even if they \"remove\" or rather delist it from the site, the link will still work as long as you seed or others are seeding it but I can't really advice you here as I did not test it yet. I'm going to sound like a negative bitch who just wants to shoot down everyone's ideas. But, I'm not trying to do that. I'm just looking for a practical solution that will work. Here's the problem. 99% of the general public are morons who refuse to learn anything new. Anything that requires downloading, addons or more than a \"tap to play\" will chase away the majority. The other problem is that 80% of all web traffic is mobile phone. So, everything kind of has to be a responsive clone of youtube or has an app. The easiest solution is to find a tube site that doesn't give a damn what they host. But, that's easier said than done So, I'll look at Dtube and I'll see what I find.",

All content is still available on the P2P network via the Desktop application regardless of where it's uploaded. In the future, we'll be looking into ways of providing the power of P2P over the web. So in future there should be no need for additional apps, how far into the future no one knows but I'll send you a PM when this happens or other solution comes along. Could be months, could be years. Everything take time and thanks for keeping me updated. I've been all over D.tube for the past few hours. The platform is a complete mess. For example, I understand what it's attempting to do but having to use 3rd party platforms to sign up isn't too smart. D.tube feels like a site designed by paranoid and delusional conspiracy theorists. I may have other projects that I'll be able to use the platform. But, what I'm currently working on it's just not convenient.",
