There are a lot of American VPNs, and they laud themselves on \"there is no data retention law in the USA, so you're safe with us.\" Uh, no. Any VPN in America is subject to National Security Letters and secret court orders that force said VPN to WireShark and log your traffic, and they can't tell you about it under penalty of jail . The best VPNs are going to be based in countries that don't give a crap about the copyright cartel's demands. China & Malaysia come to mind, in particular. There are also a select few in Europe that can be used, such as Mullvad (they've proven themselves to actually give a damn about principles, and will fight for them/you). In any case, do your own due diligience, and research, research, research before selecting a VPN. Don't take anyone's advertising word - look around & ask around. People trusted Hide My Ass, and we know how that turned out.",

So, currently, I'm in the US at an undisclosed location, but according to my VPN I'm in The Netherlands. Private Internet Access also helps out with setting up your SOCKS proxy in your torrent client through the VPN. Been using them for months, no issues have ever come up. You can check your public IP address when browsing here: You can check your public IP address when torrenting here: And if you browse the internet using Firefox, there is an add-on called Live IP Address which displays your current public IP address in the status bar of Firefox. Much more convenient than having to browse to a site to find it, imho. Happy sailing, my fellow pirates! ARRRRR!!!!",

So, currently, I'm in the US at an undisclosed location, but according to my VPN I'm in The Netherlands. Private Internet Access also helps out with setting up your SOCKS proxy in your torrent client through the VPN. Been using them for months, no issues have ever come up. You can check your public IP address when browsing here: You can check your public IP address when torrenting here: And if you browse the internet using Firefox, there is an add-on called Live IP Address which displays your current public IP address in the status bar of Firefox. Much more convenient than having to browse to a site to find it, imho. Happy sailing, my fellow pirates! ARRRRR!!!! How happy are you with Private Internet Access? Does it affect your Internet speed so much? The one I've tried for 3 days slows the speed down to one tenth of the normal speed (56mbs to 5mbs).",

        "content": "For the love of God and all things good, PLEASE do not use a VPN in your own country, especially Americans in America. There are a lot of American VPNs, and they laud themselves on \"there is no data retention law in the USA, so you're safe with us.\" Uh, no. Any VPN in America is subject to National Security Letters and secret court orders that force said VPN to WireShark and log your traffic, and they can't tell you about it under penalty of jail . The best VPNs are going to be based in countries that don't give a crap about the copyright cartel's demands. China & Malaysia come to mind, in particular. There are also a select few in Europe that can be used, such as Mullvad (they've proven themselves to actually give a damn about principles, and will fight for them/you). In any case, do your own due diligience, and research, research, research before selecting a VPN. Don't take anyone's advertising word - look around & ask around. People trusted Hide My Ass, and we know how that turned out.",
