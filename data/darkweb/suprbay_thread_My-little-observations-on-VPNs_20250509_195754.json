        "content": "Currently I'm using Nord, and they've been ok as far as speed-wise. They aren't able to handle a bunch of connections, like currently I'm getting brownouts in p2p I think because the software is switching around to accommodate the peer#. Also, I support abt 30 torr, but I can mostly not connect to the same leeches as I switch to the different servers around the country. I usually get traffic shaped within a day of hosing a particular city server bank/node and have to switch to a different city. They supposed to have p2p friendly servers but they're very difficult to find in this silly mashed up list they provide. As far as I can tell Nord is on the hate list. They just added a couple hundred new ips and those were essentially banned within a week. It's weird, cause the small guys are all banning Nord, but the big guys like google or X all're fine with Nord. So it's like the small guys are shooting themselves in the foot. Small retailers, especially shopify storefronts absolutely won't do business, small forums won't even load a page, my local five outlet grocery store won't load, but WM will, etc... Further controlled destruction of the 'middle class'?!!!? Opera built in vpn used about 50 dns servers farm that were all located in Wash. DC, USA (DOJ?). That is absolutely NOT NORMAL! I've used probably 7-8 paid vpns over the years. SUrfshark and nord were best mainly for speed and bonding p2p to the kill switch. I went a 2nd yr on surfshark and the speeds completely went to crap. I tried to get a refund and they told me to F myself cause they're in the Caribbean. The speeds did come back during the next month, but their attitude completely blows. Addl., Surfshark became investigated by the DOJ in a couple of their server nodes , Manasas, VA, I think, for p2p, of course. Proton is likely the best for actual privacy/security, but they were horrid for p2p. PIA was bad speeds and I was able to get their <30 day usage refund. I had several mid tier vpns that I cannot remember who, and they were adequate for my smaller <5MB connection before I upgraded. Bottom line is these services all seem to slowly deteriorate over contract time and I've usually switched when the contract is over.
