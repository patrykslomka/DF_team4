        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

        "content": "Over the past 18 years, ever since P2P clients made their run into the big time, users have been trying to figure out a way to avoid expensive lawsuits. At the beginning, no real solutions were available, so it was a roll of the dice from start to finish. People either got lucky, or they didn’t. The majority did but a significant number didn’t feel like taking so many chances. Somewhere along the way, so-called ‘peer-blocking’ applications raised their head. These pieces of software act like a firewall on a user’s computer, with the aim of preventing ‘hostile’ IP addresses from connecting to a torrent client, for example, thus preventing lawsuits. Over the years, millions of users installed these programs (along with the blocklists containing the supposed IP addresses of anti-piracy groups) believing that no ‘bad players’ could access their machines. Unfortunately for those using them, these blocklists were completely ineffective and remain so today. Peer-blocking applications should have died a death more than a decade ago but for some inexplicable reason, torrent users on many public forums continue to post about them, asking whether they’re doing the job they’re supposed to and if additional precautions are needed. Despite plenty of information to the contrary, some still swear by these lists and a few stubbornly believe they are “better than nothing”. If locking every window on a house but leaving the front door open is “better than nothing” to prevent burglars, then it’s difficult to disagree. If making sure is the aim, blocklists should be thrown in the trash can marked ‘placebo’. The problem is the way these things work. Peer-blocking applications use lists of IP addresses (generally compiled by volunteers) which are thought to be connected to anti-piracy, copyright trolls, government bodies, and others interested in stopping piracy. The aim is that if all of these IP addresses can be blocked, the problem can be solved. Years ago, when people had less understanding of these matters, blocklists seemed like the tool everyone needed. However, blocklists are massively incomplete, woefully out-of-date, and cannot ever hope to ‘know’ every IP address used by every anti-P2P group. For those that still aren’t convinced, let’s take site-blocking as an example. When ISPs block ‘pirate’ websites, they prevent users from accessing either their domain names, IP addresses, or DNS. When customers try to access any or all of these things, a firewall on the ISP’s end prevents the connection. No further explanation is necessary because after a decade of blocking, most proficient users generally understand how these things work. Now think for a moment how easily these blocks are defeated. As soon as an order is handed down, sites can grab a new domain, a new IP address, or have their traffic funneled through any number of proxies and mirrors. Users, for their part, can evade bans by using these modified services or utilizing tools like VPNs. Blocking is very easily bypassed. Now for the big non-surprise: anti-piracy groups can deploy just as many and more techniques to ensure that their entries on blocklists are out-of-date or completely irrelevant. Their tracking machines can be shifted around IP addresses in the blink of an eye, through datacenters or even residential ISPs, if there is a real need for stealth. No one anywhere on the planet – no matter how clever or resourceful – has the skill or resources to keep up with these changes and/or make a blocklist that deals with them all. A hundred people couldn’t manage it, nor could a thousand. The information required simply isn’t made public and the result is the publication of blocklists that massively overblock legitimate resources while letting through who-knows-what. The only real way to ensure that your IP address is never connected to ‘bad players’ while using torrents is to use something like a VPN . Or, of course, don’t share copyrighted content in the first place. Blocklists have never worked to the extent required and will never work in the future. Anyone who trusts them may as well use a fishing net as a rain hat. It’ll still catch some fish but don’t expect it to keep you dry.

        "content": "Note that TF has an obvious financial interest in steering you to their \"partner solutions\", so that is why they keep repeating already-debunked theories why \"you can't protect yourself\" and \"blocklists can't possibly work\" without spending money in the partner VPNs they advertise. VPNs do work, to be sure, but everyone knows even the best are a slight drag on performance and, of course, none of them will let you heavy P2P users ride for free. ‌ Money to be made, see? ‌ ‌ ‌ TF already knows, because they have been told, that large commercial operations tend to stick to IP address ranges without a lot of flailing about because they have to pay for each twitch, only to be caught and blocked every time they move [sometimes in a matter of hours, not days] and use of residential ranges was tried, found inefficient and abandoned many years ago. ‌ What was posted here is just the stubborn opinions of one guy who refused to learn from those actually in the scene and dug in his heels instead of listening to people who have more experience watching and responding to those copyright \"enforcement\" operations over the past [roughly] eighteen years. That's the difference between a blogger and active workers. ‌ We actually learn and gain experience. ‌ ‌ ‌ If trolls see your IP address in a tracker or DHT but can't connect they move on to easier victims from whom they can at least claim to have gathered \"evidence\" because there are always plenty of those. Some weaker rackets may try to send extortionate \"settlement notices\" but most know to ignore them. Contrail: Blocklists don't actually slow you down because they are the simplest digital filter which consumes nearly zero CPU cycles compared to the OS and applications running at the same time. In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all.",

In fact, they do the opposite because they effortlessly quench all hostile traffic in both directions if the offenders are in your list. ‌ If you are sharing and downloading files in which copyright trolls are interested, the use of such a filter subtracts all their traffic at very little cost in CPU and memory. I have been using blocklists since P2P was invented and consistently enjoy hundreds of gigabytes of unrestricted traffic every month. ‌ Not only that but the trolls haven't sent any complaints at all. Ok probably should try it again and see because I could have been doing something wrong, but yes in this day and age still to be 100% sure and safe it still is the best option to use VPN.",
