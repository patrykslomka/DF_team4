# Forum Discourse Analysis: Dark Web & Reddit

## Overview
This project analyzes and compares discussions from Dark Web forums and Reddit using advanced topic modeling and NLP techniques. It includes scraping, preprocessing, topic modeling (LDA, NMF, KMeans, BERTopic), and rich visualizations to reveal key themes and differences between the two sources.

## Data Sources
- **Dark Web:** Scraped from SuprBay (The Pirate Bay's forum) and similar sources.
- **Reddit:** Scraped from security/privacy-related subreddits.

## Pipeline
1. **Scraping:**
   - `opsec_scraper.py` and `suprbay_scraper.py` collect posts and threads from Reddit and Dark Web forums.
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - `preprocess.py` cleans, tokenizes, removes stopwords, and lemmatizes text. Output: `processed_data.json`.
3. **Topic Modeling & Analysis:**
   - `forum_analyzer.py` runs four topic modeling techniques (LDA, NMF, KMeans, BERTopic) on both sources.
   - Extracts and visualizes the top 10 most important words for each model/source.
   - Generates topic prevalence plots and word clouds for context.
4. **Visualizations:**
   - All results are saved in `analysis_results/visualizations/` as interactive HTML and PNG files.

## Setup
### Option 1: Native (Local) Setup
1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **(Optional) Download NLTK data:**
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
   ```

### Option 2: Docker (Recommended for Reproducibility)
1. **Build and start the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. **Get a shell in the running container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec forum-analysis bash
   ```
3. **Run your scripts as usual inside the container:**
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   python forum_analyzer.py
   # etc.
   ```

## Usage
### 1. Scrape Data
- **Reddit:**
  ```bash
  python opsec_scraper.py
  ```
- **Dark Web:**
  ```bash
  python suprbay_scraper.py
  ```

### 2. Preprocess Data
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### 3. Analyze & Visualize
```bash
python forum_analyzer.py
```
- Results: See `analysis_results/visualizations/` for bar charts, word clouds, and topic prevalence plots.

## Main Outputs
- `bar_topwords_darkweb_{MODEL}.html` and `bar_topwords_reddit_{MODEL}.html`: Top 10 words for each model/source.
- `wordcloud_{source}_{MODEL}.png`: Word clouds for each model/source.
- `topic_prevalence_{MODEL}.html`: Topic prevalence plots.

## Notes
- Requires Python 3.8â€“3.11 (or use Docker for a consistent environment).
- For Dark Web scraping, Tor must be running (see suprbay_scraper.py for details).
- All scripts are modular; you can run only the parts you need.
